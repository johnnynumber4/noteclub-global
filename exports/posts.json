    "wikiDesc": "A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released in the UK on 7 September 1987 by EMI and the following day in the US on Columbia. It was recorded primarily on guitarist David Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria.\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason was the first Pink Floyd album recorded without founding member Roger Waters, who departed in 1985. The production was marred by legal fights over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, which were not resolved until several months after release. It also saw the return of keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who was fired from the band by Waters during the recording of The Wall (1979).Unlike most earlier Pink Floyd records, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is not a concept album. It includes writing contributions from outside songwriters, following Gilmour's decision to include material once intended for his third solo album. The album was promoted with three singles: the double A-side \"Learning to Fly\" / \"Terminal Frost\", \"On the Turning Away\", and \"One Slip\".\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason received mixed reviews; some critics praised the production and instrumentation but criticised Gilmour's writing, and it was derided by Waters. It was nonetheless a commercial comeback for the band, reaching number three in the UK and US, and outsold Pink Floyd's previous album The Final Cut (1983). The album was supported by a highly successful world tour between 1987 and 1989, including free performance on a barge floating on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Master of Puppets is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on March 3, 1986, by Elektra Records. Recorded in Denmark at Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it was the band's last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident in Sweden during the album's promotional tour.\nThe album's artwork, designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam, depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a clouded, blood-red sky, with a fiery orange glow on the horizon. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist.\nMaster of Puppets peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its music and political lyrics. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential metal albums of all time, and is credited with consolidating the American thrash metal scene. It was certified six times platinum by the RIAA in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States, and was later certified six times platinum by Music Canada and platinum by the BPI. In 2015, Master of Puppets became the first metal recording to be selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 January 1977 through Harvest Records and Columbia Records. It was self-produced at Pink Floyd's Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions that made up their previous works, including Wish You Were Here (1975).\nAnimals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of Pink Floyd's work. Tension within the band during production culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright being fired two years later. The album's cover, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters and designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson, shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.\nPink Floyd released no singles from Animals but promoted it through the In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next album, The Wall (1979). Animals reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered one of the band's best works.\n\n",

The band primarily consists of four fictional members: 2-D (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their universe is presented in media such as music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz' music has featured collaborations with a wide range of featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop sound of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic and world music. The band's 2001 debut album, Gorillaz, which features dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the lead single, \"Clint Eastwood\". Their second studio album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, and spawned the successful lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\" The band's third album, Plastic Beach (2010), features environmentalist themes, synth-pop elements and an expanded roster of featured artists. Their fourth album, The Fall, was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010.\nIn 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a music producer for the band. Their fifth album, Humanz (2017), features a wide array of guest artists, while its follow-up, The Now Now (2018), focuses musically on Albarn. In 2020, Gorillaz started the Song Machine project, a music-based web series with episodes that consist of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, collected into their seventh album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020). The band's eighth studio album, Cracker Island (2023), met generally positive reviews as a refinement of their usual style.\nGorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout its history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. The band have sold over 33 million records worldwide and are cited by Guinness World Records as the world's \"Most Successful Virtual Band\". They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards. They have also been nominated for 11 Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.",

    "wikiDesc": "Until the Quiet Comes is the fourth studio album by American electronic music producer Flying Lotus, released on September 26, 2012 by Warp Records. Flying Lotus was inspired to create the album by psychedelic music, African percussion, and concepts of the human subconscious and dream world. He recorded for two years at his home in Los Angeles, experimenting with different mixing techniques and dynamics while primarily using an Ableton Live sequencer along with other instruments and software. The producer was accompanied on certain songs by guest vocalists, including Erykah Badu, Thom Yorke, and Laura Darlington. The album also continued his creative partnership with bassist Thundercat, who had appeared on Flying Lotus' 2010 record Cosmogramma.\nAn electronic jazz album, Until the Quiet Comes features free jazz elements, varying musical tones, contrasting scales, and shifts in rhythmic feel. Its songs are sequenced together and characterized by what music journalists noted to be ghostly vocal production, irregular drum beats, pulsating percussive textures, trembling basslines, trilled synthesizers, and fluctuating samples. The album has a journey-like concept and dreamy musical narrative, which Flying Lotus conceived while imagining himself in the process of astral projection. He later said the album could be interpreted uniquely by listeners; it has been interpreted by writers as a musical accompaniment to dreams and a process of emotional introspection by the producer.\nUntil the Quiet Comes was marketed with two singles and a short film featuring music from the album. Flying Lotus also promoted the album with an international concert tour from October to November 2012, performing at venues in North America and abroad. The album debuted at number 34 on the Billboard 200 and sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release. It was a widespread critical success, receiving praise for its complex music and Flying Lotus' sound engineering.",

    "wikiDesc": "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 is the debut studio album by the English-American supergroup Traveling Wilburys, comprising George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. It was released in October 1988 to commercial success and critical acclaim. Although Harrison had long planned to start such a band, the project came about through happenstance. Harrison was in Los Angeles and in need of a B-side for a single from his Cloud Nine album, which resulted in the participants collaborating informally on the song \"Handle with Care\" at Dylan's home. Adopting alter egos as the five Wilbury brothers, they then recorded a full album, produced by Lynne and Harrison. It was the only Wilburys album to feature Orbison, who died suddenly of a heart attack less than two months after its release. The group continued as a four-piece after his death.\nTraveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989 and helped revitalise the careers of Dylan and Petty. It has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.",

    "wikiDesc": "American rapper Kendrick Lamar has released five studio albums, one compilation album, one extended play (EP), five mixtapes, 65 singles (including 44 as a featured artist), and three promotional singles. Lamar initially performed under the stage name K.Dot, releasing three mixtapes under that moniker: Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year) (2004), Training Day (2005), and C4 (2009). He gained major attention after the release of his fourth mixtape Overly Dedicated, which was released in 2010. It was Lamar's first full-length project to be released under his birth name and fared well enough to enter the United States Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it peaked at number 72.Lamar's debut studio album Section.80, was released on July 2, 2011, and issued on independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). It peaked at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album's lead single, \"HiiiPoWeR\", was released prior to the album through iTunes. In mid-2012, Lamar began promoting his second studio album and major label debut, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. The album's first single, \"The Recipe\", peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\", the album's lead single, peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became his first top 20 hit on the chart. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was released in October 2012, through TDE, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album received universal critical acclaim and reached number two on the Billboard 200.On March 16, 2015, Lamar released his third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly. The album was preceded by two singles, \"I\" and \"The Blacker the Berry\", which charted at numbers 39 and 66 on the US Billboard Hot 100, respectively. To Pimp a Butterfly received universal critical acclaim upon release, much like its predecessor, and had global charting success, debuting at number one on the overall albums charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as topping the US Billboard 200. On March 4, 2016, Lamar released Untitled Unmastered, a compilation album containing previously unreleased demos that originated during the recording of To Pimp a Butterfly.

On April 14, 2017, his fourth studio album, Damn, was released and reached number one on the Billboard 200, and has since been certified 3× Platinum. The album spawned the singles \"Humble\", \"Loyalty\" and \"Love\", which all reached the top 15 of the US Billboard Hot 100, with \"Humble\" becoming his first number-one single in the United States as a lead artist.

    "wikiDesc": "Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on May 16, 1966 by Capitol Records. It was initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. In the United Kingdom, the album was lauded by critics and reached number 2 on the Record Retailer chart, remaining in the top ten for six months. Promoted there as \"the most progressive pop album ever\", Pet Sounds was recognized for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyrics. It is now considered to be among the greatest and most influential albums in music history.The album was produced, arranged, and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist Tony Asher. It was recorded largely between January and April 1966, a year after Wilson had quit touring with his bandmates and debuted a more progressive sound with The Beach Boys Today!. Wilson viewed Pet Sounds as effectively a solo album and credited part of its inspiration to marijuana and a newfound spiritual enlightenment. Galvanized by the work of his idol Phil Spector and rival group the Beatles, his goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\", one without filler. An early concept album, it consists mainly of introspective and semi-autobiographical songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about a lover's unwavering loyalty, \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users, and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", about social alienation.\nIncorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, psychedelia, and the avant-garde, Wilson's Wall of Sound-based orchestrations mixed conventional rock set-ups with elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, found sounds, and instruments rarely if ever associated with rock, such as bicycle bells, French horn, flutes, Electro-Theremin, string sections, and beverage cans. It marked the most complex instrumental and vocal parts of any Beach Boys album, and the first in which studio musicians (such as the Wrecking Crew) replaced the band on most of the instrumental tracks. The album could not be reproduced live and was the first time that any group departed from their usual small-ensemble pop/rock band format for a whole LP. Its unprecedented total production cost exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $580,000 in 2021). Lead single \"Caroline, No\" was issued as Wilson's official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\"). A planned successor album, Smile, was left unfinished.\n\nPet Sounds revolutionized music production and the role of professional record producers, especially through Wilson's pioneering studio-as-instrument praxis. The record contributed to the cultural legitimization of popular music, a greater public appreciation for albums, the popularity of synthesizers, and the development of psychedelic music and progressive/art rock. It also introduced novel approaches to orchestration, chord voicings, and structural harmonies; for example, most of the compositions feature a weak tonal center, rendering their key signatures ambiguous. Although it had been widely revered by industry insiders, the album was obscure to mass audiences before being reissued in the 1990s, after which it topped several critics' and musicians' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by NME, Mojo, Uncut, and The Times. As a solo artist, Wilson embarked on a string of Pet Sounds concert tours in the early 2000s and late 2010s. In 2004, the album  was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. Pet Sounds is certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating over one million units sold, and has ranked consistently as the highest rated album on Acclaimed Music since 2004. An expanded reissue, The Pet Sounds Sessions, was released in 1997 with isolated vocals and instrumental versions, session highlights, and the album's first true stereo mix. \n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Dire Straits were a British rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.Their first single, \"Sultans of Swing\", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by hit singles including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985), and \"Walk of Life\" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, Brothers in Arms (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history.  According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, the fifth most of all time.Dire Straits' sound draws from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who lasted from the beginning of the band's existence to the end. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.Dire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by Classic Rock magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 and 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Ramones is the debut studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, released on April 23, 1976, by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album.\nThe album cover, photographed by Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles, which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, although two were booked in Britain.\nViolence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and Nazism were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"Blitzkrieg Bop\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are uptempo, with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. Ramones contains a cover of the Chris Montez song \"Let's Dance\".\nRamones was unsuccessful commercially, peaking at number 111 on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, although it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on Spin magazine's list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". Ramones is considered an influential punk album in the United States and United Kingdom, and had a significant impact on other genres of rock music, such as grunge and heavy metal. The album was ranked at number 33 in Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revision and dropping to number 47 in the 2020 reboot of the list. It was placed first in the Rolling Stone 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time list in 2022. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2014.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Exodus is the ninth studio album by Jamaican reggae band Bob Marley and the Wailers, first released in June 1977 through Island Records, following Rastaman Vibration (1976). The album's production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the band, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sexuality. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of making love and keeping faith.\nOn 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley's life in which his chest was grazed and his arm was struck with a bullet, but he survived. Following the assassination attempt, Marley left Jamaica and was exiled to London, where Exodus was recorded.The album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom. In 2017, Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. There are more tracks from Exodus on Marley’s greatest hits compilation Legend than from any of his other records. Exodus was his tenth album since the debut album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, including the live album Live! (1975).\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Houses of the Holy is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 28 March 1973 by Atlantic Records. The album benefited from two band members installing studios at home, which allowed them to develop more sophisticated songs and arrangements and expand their musical style. Several songs subsequently became fixtures in the group's live set, including \"The Song Remains the Same\", \"The Rain Song\" and \"No Quarter\". Other material recorded at the sessions, including the title track, was shelved and released on the later albums Physical Graffiti and Coda. All instruments and vocals were provided by the band members Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums). The album was produced by Page and mixed by Eddie Kramer. The cover was the first for the band to be designed by Hipgnosis and was based on a photograph taken at Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.\nAlthough critical response was mixed, Houses of the Holy became a commercial success, later receiving a Diamond (over 10 million albums sold) certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999. In 2020, the album was ranked at number 278 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n",

To date, the band has sold over 120 million records worldwide. According to the RIAA the Chili Peppers have 6x Multi-Platinum, 2x Platinum and 3x Gold albums in the US, totalling 27.5m.  They also have 9x Multi-Platinum, 3x Platinum and 4x Gold singles too, totalling 40m. They have been nominated for 19 Grammy Awards, of which they have won 6. They have the most no.1 singles (15), the most cumulative weeks at no.1 (91) and most top-10 songs (28) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.  \nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers released their first three studio albums—1984's The Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1985's Freaky Styley, and 1987's The Uplift Mofo Party Plan—to virtually no commercial success during the mid to late 1980s.  However, after future success with fans visiting their early work, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan would eventually become their earliest album to be certified by the RIAA by going Gold.  It was the only album to feature all 4 founding members and featured the single 'Fight Like A Brave'. Hillel Slovak died and Jack Irons departed.  They were eventually replaced by John Frusciante and Chad Smith.It was not until their fourth studio album, 1989's Mother's Milk, that the band received critical attention when the album peaked at no.52 on the Billboard 200.  It became their first album to go Gold and would eventually go onto reach Platinum status.  'Knock Me Down' would be the first single and it became their first ever entry on the Alternative Rock Songs chart reaching no.6.  The follow up single was a cover of Stevie Wonder's 'Higher Ground' it only managed to peak at no.11 on the Alternative Rock Songs chart but was the song that started to get Chili Peppers more attention.  'Taste the Pain' was also released as a single.  Although not on Mother's Milk but recorded around the same time and featured on the 'Pretty Women' soundtrack,  the Chili Peppers released the single 'Show Me Your Soul' which reached no.10.\n After releasing their fifth studio album Blood Sugar Sex Magik in September 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers broke into the mainstream. They had switched their record label from EMI to Warner Brothers and now had producer Rick Rubin on board.  The first single 'Give It Away' became a big success and gave them their first no.1 on the Alternative Rock Charts and went Platinum.   But it was the second single \"Under the Bridge\" which made them household names.  Although it only reached no.6 on the Alternative Rock Charts it peaked at no.2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and has gone 6xPlatinum.  Other singles released were 'Suck  My Kiss'  reaching no.15 and going Gold and 'Breaking the Girl' reaching no.19 and also going Gold.  The album went on to reach 7xPlatinum in the United States reaching no.3 on the Billboard 200 album chart and gave them a no.1 album in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  BSSM became a foundation for alternative rock in the 1990s. Guitarist John Frusciante quit the band shortly thereafter in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall who was fired in 1993 being briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias before he too departed.  Recorded in the Blood Sugar Sex  Magik sessions but didnt appear on the album, the Chili Peppers released 'Soul To Squeeze' from the 'Coneheads' soundtrack.  The single reached no.1 on the Alternative Rock Charts.\nIn 1994 former record label EMI released 'What Hit's?' a compilation of songs from the Chili Peppers first 4 albums.  They promoted it with the single 'Behind The Sun' a track from 1987s Uplift Mofo Party Plan album.  It reached no.7 on the Alternative Rock Charts.  The album reached no.22 on the Billboard 200 and went Platinum.\nThe Chili Peppers search for a new guitarist ended when they recruited Dave Navarro from fellow L.A. Alternative band Jane's Addiction.   The Chili Peppers would release their sixth studio album, One Hot Minute, in September 1995.  The album was a sizable hit, peaking at no.4 on the US Billboard 200 and going 2xPlatinum.  It reached no.1 in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Finland whilst landing in the top 3 in numerous other countries.  The first single 'Warped' reached no.7 on the Alternative Rock Charts and was followed by 'My Friends' no.1 and 'Aeroplane' no.8.  Although it was popular it failed to match the success of its predecessor Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  In 1997 the Chili Peppers released the single 'Love Rollercoaster' from the Beavis and Butthead Do America' soundtrack, reaching no.14.  Navarro was fired in 1998 as the band was starting to work on their follow-up to One Hot Minute.  \nAfter a six-year absence John Frusciante rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998 and they released their seventh studio album, Californication, in June 1999. It was a commercial success, peaking at no.3 on the Billboard 200 and being certified 7xPlatinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

It reached the no.1 position in 18 countries around the world including UK, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and Holland.

The new release was titled The Getaway and came out in June 2016. \"Dark Necessities\", the first single from the album, hit the no.1 spot on the Alternative Rock chart and was certified Platinum.

    "wikiDesc": "Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on June 2, 1998, by Virgin Records. After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent yearlong world tour, follow-up Adore was considered \"one of the most anticipated albums of 1998\" by MTV. Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems, musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums, and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize Adore as made by \"a band falling apart\". Corgan was also going through a divorce and the death of his mother while recording the album.The result was a much more subdued and electronica-tinged sound that Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called \"a complete break with the past\". The album divided the Smashing Pumpkins fan base and sold only a fraction of their previous two albums. However, similar to the band's other releases across the decade, the album was critically acclaimed, becoming the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance, and has retrospectively gained a cult following. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on CD and vinyl in September 2014 as a part of the band's project to reissue their back catalogue from 1991 to 2000. This is their only album to be recorded as trio, and their first album not to feature an official drummer.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Spinal Tap (stylized as Spın̈al Tap, with a dotless letter i and a metal umlaut over the n) is a fictional English heavy metal band created by the American comedians and musicians of The T.V. Show who wrote and performed original songs as the band: Michael McKean, as the lead singer and guitarist David St. Hubbins; Christopher Guest, as the guitarist Nigel Tufnel; and Harry Shearer, as the bassist Derek Smalls. They are characterized as \"one of England's loudest bands\".Spinal Tap first appeared on the 1979 ABC television sketch comedy pilot The T.V. Show, starring Rob Reiner. The sketch, actually a mock promotional video for the song \"Rock and Roll Nightmare\", was written by Reiner and the band, and included the songwriter-performer Loudon Wainwright III on keyboards. The band starred in the 1984 mockumentary film This Is Spinal Tap, which was accompanied by a soundtrack album. \nIn the years following the film's release, the actors have portrayed the band members at concerts and released music under the Spinal Tap name. Guest, McKean and Shearer toured in the United States in April and May 2009 and performed as Spinal Tap in a \"One Night Only World Tour\" on June 30, 2009, at Wembley Arena in London, three days after playing the Glastonbury Festival.The trio also portray the fictional American folk music revival band the Folksmen; some Spinal Tap concert appearances have featured Guest, McKean and Shearer opening for Spinal Tap as the Folksmen.",

It was released on May 11, 1998, by Mushroom Records worldwide, with the North American release on Almo Sounds the following day. With this album, the band aimed to improve and expand upon the style of their 1995 eponymous debut rather than reinventing their sound. Lead singer Shirley Manson wrote dark, introspective lyrics, which she felt complemented the songs' melodies.\nVersion 2.0 was a commercial success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, France, and New Zealand, and earning platinum certifications in several countries. The album has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States and four million copies worldwide. Garbage embarked on an 18-month-long world tour, and released a string of commercially successful singles backed with innovative music videos. Version 2.0 received generally positive reviews from critics, and was included on year-end lists of 1998's best albums by several publications. In 1999, it was nominated for Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. The album's third single \"Special\" was further nominated the following year for Best Rock Song and for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\n",

It was the first studio album recorded by the Mark II line-up of Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Jon Lord and Ian Paice.\nWork on In Rock began shortly after Gillan and Glover joined the band in June 1969, with rehearsals at Hanwell Community Centre. The music was intended to be loud and heavy, and accurately represent the group's live show. Recording took place at various studios around London in between extensive touring, during which time songs and arrangements were honed into shape.\nIn Rock was the band's breakthrough album in Europe and peaked at No. 4 in the UK, remaining in the charts for over a year. By contrast, it under-performed in the US, where the band's Mark I albums had been more successful. An accompanying single, \"Black Night\" reached No. 2 in the UK, becoming their highest charting single there. The album has continued to attract critical praise as a key early example of the hard rock and heavy metal genres.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Sublime is the third and final studio album by American ska punk band Sublime. Produced by Paul Leary and David Kahne, the album was released on July 30, 1996, in the United States by MCA Records. Sublime formed in 1988 in Long Beach, California by vocalist/guitarist Bradley Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson, and drummer Bud Gaugh. The trio toured heavily from their inception while developing their sound. Their first studio release—40 Oz. to Freedom (1992)—featured the single \"Date Rape\", which attracted heavy airplay in Southern California. MCA signed the band and distributed their second independent album, Robbin' the Hood, in 1994.\nBy the time it came to record their major label debut, Nowell had been struggling with a heroin addiction. Sublime was recorded over a period of three months in Austin, Texas, in sessions characterized by heavy drug use and raucous partying. The album's musical style contains elements of punk rock, reggae, and ska, as well as dancehall, hip hop, and dub music, with tempos ranging wildly. Nowell's lyrical subject matter relates to relationships, prostitution, riots, and addiction. Nowell had been ejected from the recording near its completion. Nowell died due to a heroin overdose in May 1996, just two months prior to the band's major album release, which led to the band's dissolution.\nBolstered by numerous hit singles, among them \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", and \"Wrong Way\", the record proved to be enormously successful, despite the band being defunct and thus not able to promote the album through touring. It sold over five million copies in the United States by the end of the decade, and it continues to be a popular catalog album. The album was released during the third wave ska peak, and etched Sublime into a permanent place among the stars of the 1990s. Critical reviews were positive, praising Nowell's songwriting ability and the album's musical variety. Sublime has since been listed as one of the most well-regarded albums of the 1990s by Spin and Rolling Stone.",

These songs followed specific themes described by Mäenpää as majestic, \"spacy\", and melodic. While Mäenpää planned to perform and record each instrument for the first album himself, he still required a drummer. He sent demos to Kai Hahto, former member of Rotten Sound, who agreed to perform the drums.\nAfter obtaining a record deal, Mäenpää scheduled studio time to record the first album. Ensiferum's tour to support their 2004 release was scheduled at the same time, which forced Mäenpää to request time off from the band. The band instead fired him, and Mäenpää was free to go ahead with the production of his self-titled album, Wintersun.\nAfter the release of Wintersun, the band found permanent members to perform shows and promote the album, although a keyboardist would never be found. In 2006, Wintersun began work on their second and third albums, Time I and Time II, which were initially intended to be released as a single album. Recording began in May of that year, but the albums would be the recipient of years-long delays for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which was the complexity of each song's mix.\nTwo of the band's members, drummer Kai Hahto and bassist Jukka Koskinen, are also members of symphonic metal band Nightwish.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Electric Ladyland is the third and final studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the final studio album released before Hendrix's death in 1970.  A double album, it was the only record from the Experience produced by Hendrix. The band's most commercially successful release and its only number one album, it was released by Reprise Records in the United States on October 16, 1968, and by Track Records in the UK nine days later. By mid-November, it had reached number one on the U.S. charts, spending two weeks there. In the UK it peaked at number six, where it spent 12 weeks on the chart.\nElectric Ladyland includes a cover of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\", which became the Experience's best-selling single, reaching number six in the UK and 20 in the United States. Although the album confounded critics in 1968, it has since been viewed as Hendrix's best work and one of the greatest rock records of all time. Electric Ladyland has been featured on many greatest-album lists, including Q's 2003 list of the 100 greatest albums and Rolling Stone's 2020 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, on which it was ranked 53rd.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Sacred Hearts Club is the third studio album by American indie pop band Foster the People, released on July 21, 2017, through Columbia Records. The album was preceded by the extended play III, which is composed of three tracks from the album. Departing from the organic, acoustic sound of their previous 2014 album, it draws upon soul, dance, and electronic genres while maintaining their signature indie pop sound. The lyrics address themes of love, politics, fame, and youth, and, similar to their previous albums, are often at odds with the upbeat musical production. This is also their first studio album to feature long-time touring musicians Isom Innis and Sean Cimino as official members. It is also the band's final album to feature drummer Mark Pontius, who left the band in October 2021. It received primarily mixed reviews upon release, with many critics praising the experimentation while disliking the album's lack of musical consistency. Despite the mixed reception, the album's single \"Sit Next to Me\" has reached a peak of number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over two million copies across North America.",

    "wikiDesc": "Cheshire Cat is the debut studio album by American rock band Blink-182 (then known as simply \"Blink\"), released on February 17, 1995, by Cargo Music. The trio, composed of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor, formed in 1992 and recorded three demos that impressed the San Diego–based Cargo label. In addition, their reputation as an irreverent local live act at venues such as SOMA alerted the label, who was seeking to expand into different genres.\nDue to budget constraints, the album was recorded quickly with producer Otis Barthoulameu at Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles. Producer Steve Kravac engineered the recording and advised the trio to record additional overdubs. As such, the band spent an additional week re-recording several tracks at Santee, California's Doubletime Studios. The album was originally released with the band's name as Blink, until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action, after which the band appended \"-182\" to the end of their name.\nReleased during the breakthrough year for punk rock in California, the album brought the band great success in and outside of the San Diego skate punk scene. \"M+M's\" and \"Wasting Time\" were released as singles to promote the album, and received popularity locally through radio play. The band toured in support of the album vigorously, most notably on the GoodTimes Tour in 1995, which brought them outside of California for the first time. Cheshire Cat is cited by bands and fans as an iconic release, and has sold over 250,000 copies as of 2001.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Ten is the debut studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released on August 27, 1991, through Epic Records. Following the dissolution of their previous band Mother Love Bone in 1990, bassist Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard began rehearsing with new guitarist Mike McCready. The group recorded a five-song instrumental demo tape with Matt Cameron on drums. Copies of the demo were eventually given to drummer Dave Krusen and vocalist Eddie Vedder, both of whom were invited to audition for the band in Seattle. Many of the songs on Ten were instrumental jams or reworked Mother Love Bone songs for which Vedder composed new melodies and lyrics.Despite its reputation as a quintessential grunge album, Ten is often noted for displaying a stronger classic rock influence than other contemporary grunge releases. In a review for AllMusic, Steve Huey asserted that the band's \"intricately arranged guitar textures and expansive harmonic vocabulary... especially recalled Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin\" and characterizes the album as having an \"anthemic\" and \"warm, rich sound\". Huey also praised Vedder for the \"highly distinctive timbre\" of his vocals and for the \"passionate commitment of his delivery\".Ten was not an immediate success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200. The album produced three hit singles: \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\". \"Jeremy\" became one of Pearl Jam's best-known songs, and received nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock Performance at the 35th Grammy Awards.  MTV put the video for \"Jeremy\"  into heavy rotation; it received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video.Beyond its role in consolidating the mainstream success of grunge rock in the early 1990s, Ten is generally considered to have been instrumental in the rise and dominance of alternative rock throughout the decade. The album has since been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest albums of all time. By February 2013, it had sold 13 million copies in the US, becoming the 22nd record to do so in the Nielsen SoundScan era and has been certified 13× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Ten remains Pearl Jam's most commercially successful album.\n\n",

It was released on 14 August 2009 by Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings, and recorded from December 2008 to February 2009 at the label's in-house studio in London. Producing the album, Jamie Smith of the xx created electronic beats for the songs on his laptop and mixed them in a detailed process with the audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald, who attempted to reproduce the intimate, unembellished quality of the band's original demos.\nAlong with the xx's early R&B influences, the album has drawn comparisons from journalists to alternative rock, electronica and post-punk sounds. Its largely melancholic songs feature minimalist arrangements built around Smith's beats and instrumental parts recorded by the other members of the band, including Oliver Sim's basslines and sparse guitar figures by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employs reverb in her lead guitar playing. Most of the songs are sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom had written emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss and desire.\nReleased to widespread acclaim, xx was named one of 2009's best records and received praise for the band's atmospheric style of indie rock and pop as well as the interpersonal dimension of the performances. Commercially, it performed steadily over its first few years of release, becoming a sleeper hit in the United Kingdom and the United States, and eventually sold one million copies. Although major media outlets had largely ignored the band at first, and none of its singles became hits, xx received greater exposure from the licensing of its songs to television programmes and the band's Mercury Prize win for the album in 2010.\nShortly after the album's release, and with differences between Qureshi and the rest of the group leading to her dismissal, the xx continued to play as a trio on a protracted concert tour that helped increase their fanbase, reputation in the press and confidence as performers. xx proved highly influential in subsequent years, as its distinctive stylistic elements were incorporated by many indie bands and top-selling pop acts. One of the most acclaimed records of its era, it has appeared on top album lists published by NME, Rolling Stone and The Guardian.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Purple Rain is the sixth studio album by American singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Prince. It was released on June 25, 1984, by Warner Bros. Records, as the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments.\nMuch of the album had a grandiose, synthesized, and psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on Purple Rain is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince's career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after Purple Rain. The music video for the album's lead single \"When Doves Cry\" sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television. The risqué lyrics of \"Darling Nikki\" raised complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center and contributed to the implementation of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers.\nPurple Rain became Prince's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks atop on the Billboard 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 122 weeks. \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Purple Rain\" peaked at number two and \"I Would Die 4 U\" peaked at number eight. In May 1996, the album was certified 13× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is Prince's commercial peak, with total sales standing at 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Prince and the Revolution won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, while Prince also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Purple Rain.\nMusic critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack's music, most famously on the spare, bass-less \"When Doves Cry\". Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances along with its consolidation of rock and R&B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors. Purple Rain is regularly ranked among the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone ranked the album number eight on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n",

The album features the extended version of the breakthrough single \"Light My Fire\" and the lengthy closer \"The End\" with its Oedipal spoken word section. Publications including BBC and Rolling Stone have considered it one of the greatest and most unique debut albums in recorded history.The Doors were working the material of their debut album throughout the year of 1966 at various stages such as the Whisky a Go Go. The album's recording started after their dismissal from the venue, under the maintenance of Elektra Records. The recording of The Doors established the band's wide range of musical influences, such as jazz, classical, blues, pop, R&B and rock music. It has been largely viewed as an essential part of the psychedelic rock evolution, while also being acknowledged as a source of inspiration to other works.\nThe Doors and \"Light My Fire\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The band released their first commercial demo tape of the same name 11 months prior to the album's release. The tape contained earlier recordings of 7 of the 10 songs found on this album.\nWith politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, the album artwork was notable for featuring a graphic photograph of Thích Quảng Đức performing self-immolation. Coincidentally, the release date for Rage Against the Machine was on November 3, 1992, the same day as the 1992 United States presidential election.\nRage Against the Machine was a critical success upon release with several critics noting the album's politically motivated agenda and praising Zack de la Rocha's strong vocal delivery. Rated number 24 on Rolling Stone's list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\", the album peaked at number 1 on the US Billboard Heatseekers chart and number 45 on the US Billboard 200 and has gone on to achieve triple platinum sales certification in the US.

Produced by Phil Ek and the band themselves, the album was released on October 21, 2003, through Sub Pop. The album title comes from a lyric in the song \"Young Pilgrims\". The album was very well received by critics, garnering an overall score of 88/100 on Metacritic. As of August 2008 according to Nielsen SoundScan, they have sold over 393,000 copies to date.Chutes Too Narrow features cleaner production standards than The Shins' \"lo-fi\" debut Oh, Inverted World. This is largely due to the album's being mixed by producer Phil Ek, who has also worked with Built to Spill and Modest Mouse. Chutes Too Narrow also departs from the band's previous keyboard-driven sound and shifts towards more emphasis on guitars.\nThe album also included violin parts on \"Saint Simon\", played by Annemarie Ruljancich, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. The cover art was designed by Jesse LeDoux. The songs \"Gone for Good\" and \"Those to Come\" were used in the 2004 film In Good Company. \"Those to Come\" was also used in the 2005 film Winter Passing.",

Created in the guest house of Burnham's Los Angeles home during the COVID-19 pandemic without a crew or audience, it was released on Netflix on May 30, 2021. Featuring a variety of songs and sketches about his day-to-day life indoors, it depicts Burnham's deteriorating mental health, explores themes of performativity and his relationship to the internet and the audience it helped him reach, and addresses topics such as climate change and social movements. Other segments discuss online activities such as FaceTiming one's mother, posting on Instagram, sexting, and livestreaming video games.\nInside follows Burnham's previous stand-up comedy special Make Happy (2016), which led him to quit performing as he began to experience panic attacks onstage during that special's tour. An album of songs from the special, Inside (The Songs), was released digitally on June 10, 2021. The special received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its music, direction, cinematography, and presentation of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics found that the special incorporates a variety of art forms including music, stand-up comedy bits, and meta-commentary, describing it as some combination of comedy, drama, documentary, and theater. For Inside, Burnham received a Peabody Award, Emmy Awards for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special, Outstanding Music Direction, and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media for \"All Eyes on Me\".\nOn the one-year anniversary of the special's release, Burnham uploaded The Inside Outtakes, an hour-long YouTube video of outtakes, unused songs, behind-the-scenes footage, and alternate takes from the special.

It was the last album released on Slash Records prior to its acquisition by London Recordings in 1996.The album was produced by Failure themselves in a process that took longer than their previous two albums, with one song being recorded and produced soon after being written, and repeating this process. Space rock themes are present in the lyrics, as well as various indirect references to drug addiction, drug-related experiences, and prostitution. The album is cyclical, in that the chiming sound effect which ends the final track \"Daylight\" begins the opening track \"Saturday Saviour\", and was the beginning of a system of numerically designated segues in Failure's studio work, which would continue on later albums.Despite receiving critical acclaim, the album failed to make an appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, but did produce a charting single with \"Stuck on You\", which reached #23 on Billboard 's Alternative Songs Chart. Seven of the album's songs were also included on Failure's Essentials, a best-of collection from 2006. Fantastic Planet would be Failure's last studio album for nineteen years until the release of The Heart Is a Monster (2015).",

The album's lead single and title track, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", which was adapted by Pete Seeger from text in the Book of Ecclesiastes, had previously been arranged in a chamber-folk style by the Byrd's lead guitarist Jim McGuinn for folk singer Judy Collins' third album, but the arrangement he used for the Byrds' recording of the song utilizes the same folk-rock style as the band's previous hit singles.The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and went to number 11 in the United Kingdom. The \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" single preceded the album by two months and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another single taken from the album, \"Set You Free This Time\", was less successful and failed to break into the top 50 in the U.S.On Turn! Turn! Turn!, McGuinn's contributions to songwriting increased and rhythm guitarist David Crosby received his first writing credit on a Byrds' album, but the band's prolific songwriter Gene Clark still contributed most of the original material. The album included two Bob Dylan covers: \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the then-unreleased song, \"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\". It would be the last Byrds' album to feature the full participation of Gene Clark until the release of the original quintet's 1973 reunion album, Byrds.\n\n",

Following the success of the re-release of their debut single \"The Sound of Silence\", Simon & Garfunkel regrouped after a time apart while Columbia issued their second album, a rushed collection titled Sounds of Silence. For their third album, the duo spent almost three months in the studio working on instrumentation and production.\nThe album largely consists of acoustic pieces that were mostly written during Paul Simon's period in England the previous year, including some songs recycled from his debut solo record, The Paul Simon Songbook. The album includes the Garfunkel-led piece \"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her\", as well as \"7 O'Clock News/Silent Night\", a combination of news reports of the day (the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the death of comedian Lenny Bruce), and the Christmas carol \"Silent Night\".\nMany critics have considered it a breakthrough in recording for the duo, and one of their best efforts. \"Homeward Bound\" had already been a top five hit in numerous countries and \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\" performed similarly. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard Pop Album Chart and was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",

    "wikiDesc": "Like a Virgin is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna, released on November 12, 1984, by Sire Records. Following the success of her self-titled debut album, Madonna wanted to become the record producer of her next album. However, her label was not ready to give her the artistic freedom and she chose Nile Rodgers instead to produce the album due to his work with David Bowie. Madonna wrote six songs on the record, five of which feature Steve Bray as a co-writer. The album was recorded at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers enlisted the help of his former Chic bandmates Bernard Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played drums. Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new technique introduced at that time.\nThe album's photographs were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make a provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. While not a substantial musical departure from Madonna's first album, she felt that the material from Like a Virgin was stronger. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from music critics; however, retrospective reviews of the album have been much more positive. Like a Virgin was a commercial success and became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200 and set the record as the first female album in history  to sell over five million copies in the United States. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) later certified it diamond for shipment of ten million units. It also reached number one in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, and remains one of the best-selling albums of all time with sales of over 21 million copies worldwide.Five singles were released from the album, including Madonna's first US number-one \"Like a Virgin\" and her first UK number-one \"Into the Groove\", the latter of which was introduced on the 1985 international reissue of the album. To promote the album, she embarked on The Virgin Tour, touring North America only. Like a Virgin has attained significance as a cultural artifact of the 1980s. Madonna proved that she was not a one-hit wonder and was able to provide herself with a permanent footing in the music world. Her songs became a lightning rod for both criticism by conservatives and imitation by the younger female population, especially \"Material Girl\" and \"Like a Virgin\". According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"Every important artist has at least one album in his or her career whose critical and commercial success becomes the artist's magic moment; for Madonna, Like a Virgin was just such a defining moment.\" In 2023, the Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry for preservation in the United States, for being a \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" recording.\n\n",

The fourth single \"Angel\" peaked at number nine, but did reach number three on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart, something the other three singles also achieved. Two of the songs, \"Adia\" and \"Angel\" were US Billboard Hot 100 top-five hits (the latter also peaking at number one on the Billboard Adult Contemparary Chart) while \"Building a Mystery\" was a top-15 hit and \"Sweet Surrender\" was a top-30 hit. \"Adia\" and \"Angel\" became her first songs to reach the top 40 in some countries outside of North America.\nThe album won four Juno Awards including for Album of the Year. \"Building a Mystery\" was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, while the instrumental-only song \"Last Dance\" won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\n\n",

The artwork for the front cover was by illustrator Neon Park and is a reference to a line from the album's third song, \"Roll Um Easy\".\nThe album is considered their landmark album with the title track as their signature song that helped further define the Little Feat sound. The band added two members (guitarist Paul Barrere and percussionist Sam Clayton) to make the more complete and familiar line-up that continued until their 1979 breakup following the death of Lowell George. Bassist Kenny Gradney was brought in to replace original bassist Roy Estrada, who had left after the band's second album, Sailin' Shoes, to join Captain Beefheart's Magic Band. This new line-up radically altered the band's sound, leaning toward New Orleans R&B/funk.It was voted number 563 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).The title track was released as a single by Warner Bros. in March 1973 in the U.S., backed with \"Lafayette Railroad\" (WB 7689) and in February 1975 in the UK, backed with \"Oh Atlanta\" (K 16524).",

    "wikiDesc": "Fragile is the fourth studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released on 12 November 1971 by Atlantic Records. It was the band's first album to feature keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who replaced Tony Kaye after the group had finished touring their breakthrough record, The Yes Album (1971).\nThe band entered rehearsals in London in August 1971, but Kaye's reluctance to play electronic keyboards led to his departure from the group. He was quickly replaced by Wakeman, whose virtuosity, compositional skills, and experience with the electric piano, organ, Mellotron, and Moog synthesizer expanded the band's sound. Due to budget and time constraints, four tracks on the album are group compositions; the remaining five are short solo pieces by each band member. The opening track, \"Roundabout\", became a popular and iconic song. The artwork for the album was the band's first to be designed by Roger Dean, who would design many of their future covers.\nFragile received a mostly positive reception, with some criticism directed at the solo tracks. It became a greater commercial success than its predecessor, reaching No. 4 on the US Billboard Top LPs chart and No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. The Fragile Tour saw Yes perform over 100 dates across the UK and the US, during which they became a headlining act. An edited version of \"Roundabout\" was released as a single in the US in January 1972, which reached No. 13. Fragile was certified Platinum in the UK and double Platinum in the US, where it has sold over two million copies. It has been remastered several times, with some containing previously unreleased tracks.",

All four members are involved in the songwriting and production process. Garbage has sold over 17 million albums worldwide.The band's eponymous debut album was critically acclaimed upon its release, selling over four million copies and achieving double platinum certification in the United Kingdom, United States and in Australia. It was accompanied by a string of increasingly successful singles from 1995 to 1996, including \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Only Happy When It Rains\". Follow-up Version 2.0, released in 1998 after a year in production, was equally successful, topping the UK Albums Chart and receiving two Grammy Award nominations. Garbage followed this by performing and co-producing the theme song to the nineteenth James Bond film The World Is Not Enough (1999).Garbage's third album Beautiful Garbage was also critically acclaimed, but failed to match the commercial success of its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded amidst the troubled production of their fourth album Bleed Like Me, but regrouped to complete the album, which was released in 2005 and peaked at a career-high number four in the U.S. The band cut short their Bleed Like Me concert tour and announced an indefinite hiatus, emphasizing that they had not broken up but rather wished to pursue separate interests. The hiatus was briefly interrupted in 2007, when the band recorded new tracks for their greatest hits album Absolute Garbage. The band reunited in 2011, and self-released their 2012 album Not Your Kind of People on their own label Stunvolume to positive reviews. Their next album, Strange Little Birds, followed in 2016. Their seventh studio album, No Gods No Masters, was released in 2021.\n\n",

He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname \"Prince of Darkness\".Born and raised in Birmingham, Osbourne became a founding member of Black Sabbath in 1968, and provided lead vocals from their self-titled debut album in 1970 to Never Say Die! in 1978. The band was highly influential on the development of heavy metal music, in particular their critically acclaimed releases Paranoid, Master of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 13 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group's final studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a February 2017 performance in their hometown, Birmingham. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title \"Godfather of Metal\".Osbourne's total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath, combined with his solo work, are over 100 million. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath and into the UK Music Hall of Fame as a solo artist and as a member of the band. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, Osbourne received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star, appearing as himself in the MTV reality show The Osbournes alongside wife and manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack.

It is the first Eagles album to feature guitarist Don Felder. On the Border reached number 17 on the Billboard album chart and has sold two million copies.\nThree singles were released from the album: \"Already Gone\", \"James Dean\" and \"Best of My Love\". The singles peaked at numbers 32, 77 and 1 respectively. \"Best of My Love\" became the band's first of five chart toppers. The album also includes \"My Man\", Bernie Leadon's tribute to his deceased friend Gram Parsons. Leadon and Parsons had played together in the pioneer country rock band Flying Burrito Brothers, before Leadon joined the Eagles.\nThis is the first album by the Eagles to be released in Quadraphonic surround sound. It was released on Quadraphonic 8-track tape and CD-4 LP. A hidden message carved into the run out groove of some vinyl LPs reads: \"He who hesitates is lunch\".\n\n",

It was the second Weezer album produced by Ric Ocasek, who produced their debut album, and it is the only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh, who replaced Matt Sharp.\nAfter the disappointing reception for their second album, Pinkerton (1996), Weezer went on hiatus and the band members worked on side projects. During this time, their fanbase grew online and Pinkerton's standing improved. After a comeback performance at the Japanese Summer Sonic Festival, Weezer began rehearsing and recording new material. Following the ambitious compositions and confessional themes of Pinkerton, songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote simpler songs with less personal lyrics.\nWeezer received generally favorable reviews. It debuted at number four in the United States, where it has since sold over 1.6 million copies. Three singles were released from the album: \"Hash Pipe\", \"Island in the Sun\", and \"Photograph\". \"Hash Pipe\" was a worldwide hit, charting on seven different charts.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "The Fragile is the third studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as a double album by Nothing Records and Interscope Records on September 21, 1999. It was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and English producer Alan Moulder, a longtime Reznor collaborator. It was recorded throughout 1997 to 1999 in New Orleans.\nLooking to depart from the distorted production of their previous album, The Downward Spiral (1994), the album features elements of ambient and electronic music within a wide variety of genres. The album continues some of the lyrical themes from The Downward Spiral, including depression and drug abuse. The album notably contains more instrumental sections than their previous work, with some entire tracks being instrumentals. The Fragile is also one of the band's longest studio releases, clocking in at nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes long. The record was promoted with three singles: \"The Day the World Went Away\", \"We're in This Together\", and \"Into the Void\", as well as the promotional single \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and an accompanying tour, the Fragility Tour, which spanned two legs. Several accompanying recordings were also released, including a remix album, Things Falling Apart (2000), a live album, And All That Could Have Been (2002), as well as an alternate version of the record, The Fragile: Deviations 1 (2016).\nUpon release, critics applauded the album's ambition and composition, although some criticized its length and perceived lack of lyrical substance. However, in the years following its release, it has come to be regarded by many critics and listeners to be among the band's best work, with some critics who initially gave the album negative reviews writing new reviews praising the album and its impact. Numerous musicians have cited the album's production as having an influence on how they approached the creation of their own work. The album debuted at number one in the U.S. to become the band's first chart-topper, and was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Disintegration is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 2 May 1989 by Fiction Records. The record marks a return to the introspective gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of 30, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the band's pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group's newfound popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The band recorded the album at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989. Following the completion of the mixing, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band.\nDisintegration became the band's highest charting album to that point, reaching number three in the United Kingdom and at number 12 in the United States, and producing several hit singles including \"Lovesong\", which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It remains the band's highest selling record to date, with more than four million copies sold worldwide. It was greeted with a warm critical reception before later being acclaimed, eventually being placed at number 116 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the \"culmination of all the musical directions the Cure were pursuing over the course of the '80s\".\n\n",

Cole. It was released on September 27, 2011, by Roc Nation and Columbia Records, with distribution from Sony Music. The album is his first studio release, following three successful mixtapes. In 2007, the album was first recorded and ended, and then began to take place from 2009 to early 2011, featuring the production that was handled mainly by Cole himself, with some production from high-profile producer No I.D. It includes four guest appearances from Trey Songz, Drake, Jay-Z and Missy Elliott.\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 218,000 copies sold in the first week following its release. The album has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of December 2016, it sold 855,000 copies in the United States. The album was supported by three official singles: Work Out, Can't Get Enough and Nobody's Perfect.\nThe album was one of the most anticipated releases of 2011 due to the sharp rise in Cole's popularity and mainstream fan base. Cole's lyrics perhaps most strikingly deal with issues such as abortion and the consequences of growing up in a fatherless household. However, these themes are incorporated alongside more introspective issues such as relationships, family problems, fame and attempting to be successful – an area which very much links in with the subtitle of the album 'The Sideline Story'. Upon its release, the album was generally well received by critics, who praised the wholesomeness of the album.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\nThe record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many of the sonic aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic  spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles, \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is among the most critically acclaimed albums and often features in professional listings of the greatest of all time. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. The Dark Side of the Moon is certified 14 times platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 981 weeks. As of 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon has sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of the 1970s and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n",

A shorter remix from 1989 was used on the 2001 and 2015 reissues instead of the longer original single version.\"Lady Starlight\" is the only song in the entire Scorpions discography so far (as of 2018) to include an arrangement for strings and orchestral winds.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Blur is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Blur, released on 10 February 1997 by Food Records. Blur had previously been broadly critical of American popular culture and their previous albums had become associated with the Britpop movement, particularly Parklife, which had helped them become one of Britain's leading pop acts. After their previous album, The Great Escape, the band faced media backlash and relationships between the members became strained.\nUnder the suggestion of the band's guitarist, Graham Coxon, the band underwent a stylistic change, becoming influenced by American indie rock bands such as Pavement. Recording took place in London as well as in Reykjavík, Iceland. Drummer Dave Rowntree described the music on the album as being more aggressive and emotional than their previous work. Producer Stephen Street claimed that lead singer-songwriter Damon Albarn had started writing about more personal experiences while Coxon revealed that listening to his lyrics it was clear to him that \"he'd obviously gone off his head a bit more\".\nDespite worries from Blur's label, EMI, and the music press that the change in style would alienate the band's predominantly teenage fanbase and that the album would flop as a result, Blur, as well as lead single, \"Beetlebum\", reached the top of the UK charts and the album was certified platinum. The album also reached the top 20 in six other countries. The success of \"Song 2\" led to Blur becoming the band's most successful album in the US where the Britpop scene had been largely unsuccessful. The album received positive reviews from most music critics, many praising the stylistic change as well as Albarn's songwriting. This is the last album to feature longtime producer Stephen Street, until his return for The Magic Whip (2015).\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Nevermind is the second album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. It was Nirvana's first release on a major label and the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work. It was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in May and June 1991, and mastered that August at the Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California.\nWritten primarily by frontman Kurt Cobain, Nevermind is noted for channeling a range of emotions, being noted as dark, humorous, and disturbing. It includes anti-establishment views, anti-sexism, frustration, alienation, and troubled love inspired by Cobain's broken relationship with Bikini Kill's Tobi Vail. Contrary to the popular hedonistic themes of drugs and sex at the time, writers have observed that Nevermind re-invigorated sensitivity to mainstream rock. According to Cobain, the sound of the album was influenced by bands such as Pixies, R.E.M., the Smithereens, and Melvins. Though the album is considered a cornerstone of the grunge genre, it is noted for its musical diversity, which includes acoustic ballads (\"Polly\" and \"Something in the Way\") and punk-inspired hard rock (\"Territorial Pissings\" and \"Stay Away\").Nevermind became an unexpected critical and commercial success, hitting top 10 charts across the world. By January 1992, it reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. The lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" reached the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 and went on to be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Its video was also heavily rotated on MTV. Three other successful singles were released: \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", and \"In Bloom\". The album was voted the best album of the year in Pazz & Jop critics' poll, while \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls. The album also garnered the band three Grammy Award nominations in total across the 34th and 35th Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album.\nNevermind and its singles' success propelled Nirvana to being widely regarded as the biggest band of the 1990s, with Cobain being dubbed by critics as the \"voice of his generation.\" The album brought grunge and alternative rock to a mainstream audience while ending the dominance of hair metal, drawing similarities to the early 1960s British Invasion of American popular music. It is also often credited with initiating a resurgence of interest in punk culture among teenagers and young adults of Generation X, becoming seminal to the counterculture of the decade. It has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In March 1999, it was certified Diamond by the RIAA. Among the most acclaimed and influential albums in the history of music, Nevermind was added to the National Recording Registry in 2004 as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and is frequently ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time. The album has since been reissued with alternate takes and live performances.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Sticky Fingers is the 9th British and 11th American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones.  The Stones released it on 23 April 1971 on their new, and own label Rolling Stones Records.   They had been contracted by Decca Records and London Records in the UK and the US since 1963.  On this album Mick Taylor made his second full-length appearance on a Rolling Stones album (after the live album Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!).  It was the first studio album without Brian Jones who died two years earlier. The original cover artwork, conceived by Andy Warhol and photographed and designed by members of his art collective, The Factory, showed a picture of a man in tight jeans, and had a working zip that opened to reveal underwear fabric. The cover was expensive to produce and damaged the vinyl record, so later re-issues featured just the outer photograph of the jeans.\nThe album featured a return to basics for the Rolling Stones. The unusual instrumentation introduced several albums prior was absent; most songs featuring drums, guitar, bass, and percussion as provided by the key members: Mick Jagger (lead vocal, various percussion and rhythm guitar), Keith Richards (guitar and backing vocal), Mick Taylor (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass guitar), and Charlie Watts (drums). Additional contributions were made by long-time Stones collaborators including saxophonist Bobby Keys and keyboardists Billy Preston, Jack Nitzsche, Ian Stewart, and Nicky Hopkins. As with the other albums of the Rolling Stones late 1960s/early 1970s period, it was produced by Jimmy Miller.\nSticky Fingers is considered one of the Rolling Stones' best albums. It was the band's first album to reach number one on both the UK albums and US albums charts, and has since achieved triple platinum certification in the US. \"Brown Sugar” topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971. Sticky Fingers was voted the second best album of the year in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1971, based on American critics' votes. The album is inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame and included in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Illinois (styled Sufjan Stevens Invites You to: Come on Feel the Illinoise on the cover; sometimes spelled as Illinoise) is a 2005 concept album by American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens. His fifth studio album, it features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of Illinois. Illinois  is Stevens' second based on a U.S. state—part of a planned series of fifty that began with the 2003 album Michigan and that Stevens has since acknowledged was a joke.\nStevens recorded and produced the album at multiple venues in New York City using low-fidelity studio equipment and a variety of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state—Stevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following its release, Stevens promoted Illinois with a world tour.\nCritics praised the album for its well-written lyrics and complex orchestrations. In particular, reviewers noted Stevens' progress as a songwriter since the release of Michigan. Illinois was named the best-reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator Metacritic, and was included on several reviewers' \"best of the decade\" lists—including those of Paste, NPR, and Rolling Stone. According to aggregate website Acclaimed Music, Illinois is the most acclaimed album of 2005, 7th most acclaimed album of 2000s and 95th most acclaimed album in history. The album amounted to Stevens' greatest public success to date; it was his first to place on the Billboard 200, and it topped the Billboard list of \"Heatseekers Albums\". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and the Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.",

    "wikiDesc": "The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles (15), most cumulative weeks at number one (91) and most top-ten songs (28) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.\nWith new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded Mother's Milk (1989) and their first major commercial success, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.\nIn 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, Californication (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful; Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on I'm with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th and 13th albums, Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen, in 2022.\n\n",

The album includes some tracks the band decided to not release on their debut EP Opiate. This is their only album to feature original bassist Paul D'Amour.\nAccording to AllMusic, Undertow helped heavy metal music remain prominent as a mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. AllMusic saw the album's success in the \"striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\"As of 2020, Undertow has sold over three million copies in the United States, and is certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "All Things Must Pass is the third studio album by English rock musician George Harrison. Released as a triple album in November 1970, it was Harrison's first solo work after the break-up of the Beatles in April that year. It includes the hit singles \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\", as well as songs such as \"Isn't It a Pity\" and the title track that had been overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of Harrison's musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends and Billy Preston during 1968–70, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. All Things Must Pass introduced Harrison's signature slide guitar sound and the spiritual themes present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams titled Apple Jam. Several commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.\nProduction began at London's EMI Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and members of Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.\nAll Things Must Pass was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number one on charts worldwide. Co-producer Phil Spector employed his Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as \"Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: \"Garbo talks! – Harrison is free!\" According to Colin Larkin, writing in the 2011 edition of his Encyclopedia of Popular Music, All Things Must Pass is \"generally rated\" as the best of all the former Beatles' solo albums.During the final year of his life, Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album's release. After this reissue, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album six-times platinum. It has since been certified seven-times platinum, with at least 2 million albums sold. Among its appearances on critics' best-album lists, All Things Must Pass was ranked 79th on The Times' \"The 100 Best Albums of All Time\" in 1993, while Rolling Stone placed it 368th on the magazine's 2020 update of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2014, All Things Must Pass was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Thriller is the sixth studio album by the American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson, released on November 29, 1982, by Epic Records. It was produced by Quincy Jones, who had previously worked with Jackson on his 1979 album Off the Wall. Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". With the ongoing backlash against disco music at the time, he moved in a new musical direction, resulting in a mix of pop, post-disco, rock, funk, and R&B sounds. Thriller foreshadows the contradictory themes of Jackson's personal life, as he began using a motif of paranoia and darker themes. Paul McCartney appears on \"The Girl Is Mine\", the first credited appearance of a featured artist on a Michael Jackson album. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000.\nThriller became Jackson's first number-one album on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it spent a record 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one, from February 26, 1983, to April 14, 1984. Seven singles were released: \"The Girl Is Mine\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\", \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \", \"Human Nature\", \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\", and \"Thriller\". They all reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, setting a record for the most top 10 singles from an album, with \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" reaching number one. Following Jackson's performance of \"Billie Jean\" in the Motown 25 television special, where he debuted his signature moonwalk dance, the sales of the album significantly increased, selling one million copies worldwide per week. The \"Thriller\" music video was premiered to great anticipation in December 1983 and played regularly on MTV, which also increased the sales.\nWith 32 million copies sold worldwide by the end of 1983, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. It was the best-selling album of 1983 worldwide, and in 1984 it became the first album to become the best-selling in the United States for two years. It set industry standards with its songs, music videos, and promotional strategies influencing artists, record labels, producers, marketers, and choreographers. The success gave Jackson an unprecedented level of cultural significance for a black American, breaking racial barriers in popular music, earning him regular airplay on MTV and leading to a meeting with US President Ronald Reagan at the White House. Thriller was among the first albums to use music videos as promotional tools; the videos for \"Billie Jean\", \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller\" are credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form.\nThriller is the best-selling album of all time, with sales of 70 million copies worldwide. It is the best selling non-compilation album and second-best-selling album overall in the United States and was certified 34× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021. It won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, while \"Beat It\" won Record of the Year. Jackson also won a record-breaking eight American Music Awards at the 1984 American Music Awards. The album has been a frequent inclusion in lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2008, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In the same year, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry of \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant recordings\".\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Animal is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Kesha. The album was released on January 1, 2010, by RCA Records. Kesha worked on the album with a variety of record producers and songwriters such as Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, Benny Blanco, David Gamson, Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and others. Kesha had been recording demos for several years when one eventually ended up in the hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at BMI. Cox passed along the demo and it ended up in the hands of Gottwald, who decided to have Kesha perform on the song \"Right Round\" with American rapper Flo Rida. Within two months, the song became a hit in multiple countries around the world. The event led to Kesha being sought after by many major labels, and she eventually signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records.\nMusically, Animal draws from the electropop genre, while incorporating elements of dance-pop in its production and beats. Lyrically, the majority of the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the Billboard 200 in the United States and the IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. In December 2018, Animal was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 3 million copies in the United States and has since sold over 8 \nmillion equivalent units worldwide as of 2017.Four singles were released from the album. Its lead single, \"Tik Tok\", was released on August 7, 2009, and was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in eleven countries. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and stayed at the top for nine consecutive weeks. The song sold 12.8 million digital copies worldwide in 2010, making it the best-selling single of the year; whereas 6.8 million of those downloads were sold in the United States alone, making it at the time the sixth best-selling song in digital history. It has since sold over 18 million copies worldwide as of August 2019, making it one of the best-selling digital singles worldwide of all time. The album's second, third and fourth singles (\"Blah Blah Blah\", \"Your Love Is My Drug\" and \"Take It Off\") all achieved similar success, reaching the top ten in multiple countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States. The album's commercial success led to its nomination for the Juno Award for Best International Album at the Juno Awards of 2011.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Moving Pictures is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on February 12, 1981 by Anthem Records. After touring to support their previous album, Permanent Waves (1980), the band started to write and record new material in August 1980 with longtime co-producer Terry Brown. They continued to write songs with a more radio-friendly sound, featuring tighter and shorter song structures compared with their earlier albums.\nMoving Pictures received a positive reception from contemporary and retrospective music critics and became an instant commercial success, reaching number one in Canada and number 3 in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It remains Rush's highest-selling album in the United States, with 5 million copies sold. \"Limelight\", \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Vital Signs\" were released as singles across 1981, and the instrumental \"YYZ\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Rush supported the album on tour from February to July 1981.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Body Count is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. The group is fronted by Ice-T, who first established himself as a rapper but co-founded the group with lead guitarist Ernie C out of their interest in heavy metal music. Ice-T took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of Body Count's songs, while Ernie C has been responsible for writing the group's music.\nBody Count's self-titled debut album was released on Sire Records in 1992, and garnered much attention due to a controversy around the song \"Cop Killer\". Their label, Sire Records, and their parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the song; however Ice-T chose to remove it from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year, and they have since released six more albums.\nThree out of the band's original seven members are deceased: D-Roc died from lymphoma, Beatmaster V from leukemia, and Mooseman in a drive-by shooting. Body Count's current lineup includes vocalist Ice-T, guitarists Ernie C and Juan Garcia, bassist Vincent Price, drummer Will \"Ill Will\" Dorsey Jr., and backing vocalists Sean E Sean and Little Ice (Ice-T's son).\nThe band received their second Grammy nomination and later won the award at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021 for Best Metal Performance with their song \"Bum Rush\" from the album Carnivore.\n\n",

The album features the extended version of the breakthrough single \"Light My Fire\" and the lengthy closer \"The End\" with its Oedipal spoken word section. Publications including BBC and Rolling Stone have considered it one of the greatest and most unique debut albums in recorded history.The Doors were working the material of their debut album throughout the year of 1966 at various stages such as the Whisky a Go Go. The album's recording started after their dismissal from the venue, under the maintenance of Elektra Records. The recording of The Doors established the band's wide range of musical influences, such as jazz, classical, blues, pop, R&B and rock music. It has been largely viewed as an essential part of the psychedelic rock evolution, while also being acknowledged as a source of inspiration to other works.\nThe Doors and \"Light My Fire\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2015 the Library of Congress selected The Doors for inclusion in the National Recording Registry based on its cultural, artistic or historical significance. The Doors remains the band's best-selling studio album, with sales of over 13 million copies, as of 2015.",

    "wikiDesc": "Favourite Worst Nightmare is the second studio album by English rock band Arctic Monkeys, released on 23 April 2007 by Domino Recording Company. Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of lead single \"Brianstorm\" on 2 April 2007. It was the band’s first album with new bassist Nick O'Malley, replacing their previous bassist Andy Nicholson, who left the band before the North American tour of the band's debut studio album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006). \nIn comparison to their debut, the album is considered more musically ambitious, with ambient sounds and expanded drum rhythms being introduced. As with the band’s previous album, Favourite Worst Nightmare was a widespread critical success, with critics highlighting the band's new emotional depth and Alex Turner's matured songwriting. NME and Uncut ranked it the second-best album of 2007, while Dutch publication OOR named it the best of 2007. Retrospectively, the album is considered the start of the band's change of sound with each of their albums after their debut.\nIn its first week of release, the album sold over 227,000 copies, going straight to number one on the UK Albums Chart. \"Brianstorm\" and \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" were also both hits on the UK Singles Chart, with the former reaching number two on the chart. In the United States, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since been certified 4× platinum in the UK. It was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Something/Anything? is the third album by American musician Todd Rundgren, released in February 1972. It was his first double album, and was recorded in late 1971 in Los Angeles, New York City and Bearsville Studios, Woodstock. Three quarters of the album was recorded in the studio with Rundgren playing all instruments and singing all vocals, as well as being the producer. The final quarter contained a number of tracks recorded live in the studio without any overdubs, save for a short snippet of archive recordings from the 1960s.\nRundgren had become confident enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards that he had tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles in an attempt to record an entire album single-handedly. After Rundgren created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck Los Angeles. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.\nThe album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold three years after its release. A single taken from the album, \"Hello It's Me\", was a top-five hit in the US in late 1973, and it contained a further hit, \"I Saw the Light\". Something/Anything? later attracted critical acclaim as one of the most significant records of the 1970s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 173 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and later ranked at number 396 in the 2020 edition.\nIt was voted number 797 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). After Something/Anything, Rundgren moved away from the straightforward pop ballads present on this album to more experimental territory and progressive rock in later releases, beginning with A Wizard, A True Star.",

    "wikiDesc": "Red Hot Chili Peppers (RHCP) is an American funk rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in December 1982, the group originally consisted of vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea (real name Michael Balzary) and drummer Jack Irons. The group changed its name to Red Hot Chili Peppers on March 25, 1983. In December, Slovak and Irons both left RHCP, after their other band What Is This? obtained a record deal with MCA Records. They were replaced before the end of the year by Jack Sherman and Cliff Martinez, respectively, who performed on the group's self-titled debut album. After the resulting promotional concert tour ended in December 1984, Sherman was fired following tensions with Kiedis and Flea.Having recently left What Is This?, Slovak returned to RHCP in January 1985. During the tour in promotion of Freaky Styley, Martinez was replaced by the returning Jack Irons, who rejoined in April 1986 to mark the reunion of the group's original lineup. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan was released in 1987. However, after struggling with a heroin addiction for a number of years, Slovak died of an overdose on June 25, 1988 following the conclusion of the album's promotional tour. In the wake of the guitarist's death, Irons decided to leave the group. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue, adding DeWayne McKnight on guitar and D. H. Peligro on drums in August. McKnight was fired the following month and replaced by John Frusciante; Peligro was also dismissed in November, with Chad Smith taking over the following month.With its new lineup finalised, RHCP released two successful albums in Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. On May 7, 1992, however, Frusciante abruptly quit the band in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour, with several shows cancelled as a result. Arik Marshall was brought in for the remainder of the tour, before Jesse Tobias took his place the following September. Before the end of the month, however, former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro – the band's first choice to replace Frusciante – had finally agreed to join the group. The band released One Hot Minute in 1995 and toured extensively in promotion of the album. By April 1998, however, Navarro had left RHCP due to creative differences, and his desire to focus on new band Spread. Frusciante returned to the band a few weeks later.The lineup of Red Hot Chili Peppers remained constant for more than ten years following Frusciante's return, as the band continued to increase its mainstream success with 1999's Californication, 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium. After a brief hiatus starting in 2008, however, it was announced in December 2009 that the guitarist had departed for a second time, explaining that \"my musical interests have led me in a different direction\". Despite the time of the announcement, Frusciante had actually left on July 29, 2009. Josh Klinghoffer, previously a touring guitarist for the band, had taken his place when the band returned from its hiatus in October. The band released I'm with You in 2011 and The Getaway in 2016. On December 15, 2019, the band announced through their Instagram account the departure of Josh Klinghoffer and the subsequent return of John Frusciante as the lead guitarist of the band. This event marked Frusciante's second comeback, in this occasion after 10 years of absence. The band released Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen in 2022.",

    "wikiDesc": "David Bowie (commonly known as Space Oddity) is the second studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released in the United Kingdom on 14 November 1969 through Mercury affiliate Philips Records. Financed by Mercury on the strength of \"Space Oddity\", the album was recorded from June to October 1969 at Trident Studios in London. Gus Dudgeon produced \"Space Oddity\", while Tony Visconti produced the rest of the album. It featured an array of collaborators, including Herbie Flowers, Rick Wakeman, Terry Cox and the band Junior's Eyes. \nDeparting from the music hall style of Bowie's 1967 self-titled debut, David Bowie contains folk rock and psychedelic rock songs, with lyrical themes influenced by events happening in Bowie's life at the time, including former relationships and festivals he attended. \"Space Oddity\", a tale about a fictional astronaut, was released as a single in July 1969 and became Bowie's first commercial hit, reaching the UK top five. \nThe album was a commercial failure due to a lack of promotion, despite receiving some positive reviews from music critics. For its release in the United States, Mercury retitled the album Man of Words/Man of Music and used different artwork. RCA Records reissued the album under the title of Space Oddity following Bowie's commercial breakthrough with Ziggy Stardust in 1972, using a contemporary photo of Bowie as the artwork. The reissue charted in both the UK and the US.\nDavid Bowie has received mixed reviews in later decades, with many finding a lack of cohesiveness. Bowie himself later stated that it lacked musical direction. Debate continues as to whether it should stand as Bowie's first \"proper\" album. David Bowie has been reissued numerous times, with bonus tracks and variance on the inclusion of the hidden track \"Don't Sit Down\". Labels have used both David Bowie and Space Oddity as the title, with Space Oddity being used for a 2019 remix by Visconti.\n\n",

Following her death, he travels to a nearby brothel in the hopes of learning more about his mother and the life she lived as a prostitute, as he himself was the product of her profession. He eventually finds love in a prostitute named Ms. Leading, but the relationship eventually falls apart due to his inability to cope with her chosen profession.\nAccording to an interview with Casey Crescenzo for music website AbsolutePunk, the band wrote 120 minutes' worth of music for the album, but managed to trim it down to just under 80 minutes to avoid having to do a double-disc release.The album features numerous re-recorded tracks from the Dear Ms. Leading demos. Although Casey based much of the demo's lyrics on personal experiences, he has stated that the arc of falling in love with a prostitute is not based on any experience he's actually had.In June 2007, artist Kent St. John was selected to illustrate a book based on the story of Act II.

    "wikiDesc": "Brothers and Sisters is the fourth studio album by American rock band The Allman Brothers Band. Co-produced by Johnny Sandlin and the band, the album was released in August 1973 in the United States by Capricorn Records. Following the death of group leader Duane Allman in 1971, the Allman Brothers Band released Eat a Peach (1972), a hybrid studio/live album that became their biggest yet. Afterwards, the group purchased a farm in Juliette, Georgia, to become a \"group hangout\". However, bassist Berry Oakley was visibly suffering from the death of Duane, excessively drinking and consuming drugs. In November of 1972, after nearly a year of severe depression, Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident (not dissimilar from Duane’s), making it the last album on which he played.\nThe band carried on, adding new members Chuck Leavell on piano and Lamar Williams on bass. Brothers and Sisters was largely recorded over a period of three months at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, Georgia. Lead guitarist Dickey Betts assumed the role of band leader, and many of his compositions reflected a more country-inspired sound. Session guitarists Les Dudek and Tommy Talton sat in on several songs. The album was being produced at the same time as vocalist/organist Gregg Allman's solo debut, Laid Back, and features many of the same musicians and engineers. The front album cover features a photograph of Vaylor Trucks, the son of drummer Butch Trucks and his wife Linda. The back cover features a photograph of Brittany Oakley, the daughter of Berry Oakley and his wife, Linda.\nThe album represented the Allmans' commercial peak: it has sold over seven million copies worldwide, landing it at the time atop of the Top 200 Pop Albums for five weeks. \"Ramblin' Man\" became the band's first and only hit single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973. The album was followed by a tour of arenas and stadiums, but marred by drug problems, strained friendships and miscommunication between the group members.\n\n",

Drawing influence from Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, they experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of looping grooves. The sessions incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.\nByrne struggled with writer's block, but adopted a scattered, stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and crafted with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M&Co. The band hired additional members for a promotional tour, and following its completion, they went on a year-long hiatus to pursue side projects.\nRemain in Light was acclaimed by critics, who praised its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and cohesive merging of disparate genres. The album peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart, and spawned the singles \"Once in a Lifetime\" and \"Houses in Motion\". It has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and of all time, and is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus. In 2017, the Library of Congress deemed the album \"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\", and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "OK Computer is the third studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in the UK on 16 June 1997 by EMI. With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of OK Computer  in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine's Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work.\nThe album's lyrics depict a world fraught with rampant consumerism, social alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer has been said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation through recording on a staircase, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.\nDespite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified five times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide.\nOK Computer received acclaim and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for the Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the United States Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released MiniDiscs [Hacked], comprising hours of additional material.\n\n",

In some cases, the US version would be an entirely different album with different tracks, cover photos and liner notes. The first five British Rolling Stones albums were converted into seven LPs for the American market, adding material from singles and the UK EPs. The two Big Hits singles packages, from 1966 and 1969 respectively, differ in each nation, and in the case of December's Children (And Everybody's) and Flowers there are no UK counterparts.

    "wikiDesc": "2112 (pronounced \"twenty-one twelve\") is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on 1 April 1976 (or March 1976, according to some sources) by Anthem Records. \nRush finished touring for their unsuccessful previous album Caress of Steel in early 1976. The band was in financial hardship due to the album's disappointing sales, unfavourable critical reception, and a decline in attendance at its shows. The band's international label, Mercury Records, considered dropping Rush but granted the band one more album following negotiations with manager Ray Danniels. Though the label demanded more commercial material, the band decided to continue developing its progressive rock sound. 2112 was recorded in February 1976 in Toronto with regular producer Terry Brown. Its centerpiece is the 20-minute title track, a futuristic science-fiction song that takes up the entire first side of the album. There are five individual tracks on side two.\n2112 was released to favourable reviews from music critics and quickly outsold the band's previous albums. It peaked at No. 5 on the Canadian Albums Chart and No. 61 on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape and was the band's commercial breakthrough in the country. Rush supported the album with a tour of the United States, Canada, and for the first time, Europe, from February 1976 to June 1977. 2112 remains the band's second-highest-selling album (behind 1981's Moving Pictures) with more than 3 million copies sold in the United States. It is listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and ranked second on Rolling Stone's reader's poll, Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time. 2112 has been reissued several times; a 40th Anniversary Edition was released in 2016 with previously unreleased material, including the album performed by artists including Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Billy Talent,  Steven Wilson, and Alice in Chains.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "El Camino is the seventh studio album by American rock duo the Black Keys. It was co-produced by Danger Mouse and the group, and was released on Nonesuch Records on December 6, 2011. The record was the band's follow-up to their commercial breakthrough, Brothers (2010), and was their third collaboration with Danger Mouse. El Camino draws from popular genres of the 1950s to 1970s, such as rock and roll, glam rock, rockabilly, surf rock and soul.  Danger Mouse contributed as a co-writer on each of the 11 songs alongside guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney.\nThe album was recorded from March to May 2011 in Nashville, Tennessee, at Easy Eye Sound Studio, which Auerbach opened the year prior. The band approached writing and recording differently than on previous albums, as they entered the studio without having written any material and deliberated longer on how to structure songs. After struggling to translate the slower songs from Brothers to a live setting, the band wrote more uptempo, hook-laden tracks for El Camino. The album's cover art depicts a minivan similar to one the group toured in early in their career, but in an inside joke, they named the record after the El Camino muscle car. A faux newspaper advertisement and parody car commercial playing on this joke were used to promote the record prior to release.\nLead single \"Lonely Boy\" became the group's highest-charting single in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and Canada. The album received positive reviews from critics and was ranked by many publications as one of the year's best albums. It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and reached the top five of the album charts in Australia, Canada, Belgium (Flanders), and New Zealand. The album was certified multi-platinum in the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, as well as platinum in the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland. The Black Keys supported the album with the El Camino Tour, their first headlining arena tour. Four additional singles were released, including \"Gold on the Ceiling\" and \"Little Black Submarines\", which were rock radio successes. El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, while \"Lonely Boy\" received honors for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song.\n\n",

Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed. This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall, proto-metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nThe album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than most of their releases since Revolver.",

All but four songs were originally released in the box set Prince of Darkness, released earlier the same year. The additional songs are \"Rocky Mountain Way\", \"Sunshine of Your Love\", \"Woman\" and \"Go Now\". Whilst he cites The Beatles as his favourite band, his favourite song of all time is Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\". He had wished to cover this song but was advised against it since it had recently been covered by a \"close musical associate\"  (then-former guitarist Zakk Wylde covered the song with his band Black Label Society on their 2004 album Hangover Music Vol. VI).\nUnder Cover is the only Osbourne album to feature the work of Alice in Chains' guitarist Jerry Cantrell or bassist Chris Wyse.The album is also available in DualDisc format. This version contains the bonus track \"Changes\" (originally by Black Sabbath), performed by Osbourne and his daughter Kelly Osbourne. The DVD side contains all the songs in enhanced stereo, a documentary entitled Dinner with Ozzy and Friends, and a video for the song \"In My Life\".\n\"Mississippi Queen\" was released as a promo single and peaked at number 10 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.",

    "wikiDesc": "Anthem (stylized as anthem.) is the fifth studio album by American ska punk band Less Than Jake, released on May 20, 2003 on Sire Records, a Warner Bros. imprint. A year after their fourth studio album Borders & Boundaries (2000), the band had spent sometime at their practice space writing new material; by the middle of 2002, the band said their next album would be with Warner Bros. Records. Following a meeting with Rob Cavallo, he was enlisted as the producer for the album. Sessions were held at Piety Street Recording in New Orleans and Morning View Studio in Malibu, California, occurring between October and December 2002. Anthem is a pop-punk, pop rock and ska punk album that recalled the work of Good Charlotte and saw less emphasis on horn parts.\nAnthem received generally favorable reviews from critics, some of whom noted the shift away from horns into pop-punk, while others commented on Cavallo's production. It reached number 45 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. \"The Science of Selling Yourself Short\" peaked at number 36 on the US Alternative Airplay chart. Preceded by a headlining US tour, \"She's Gonna Break Soon\" was released as the album's lead single in April 2003. The band then appeared on the Honda Civic Tour, went on a European tour and then spent three months as part of the Warped Tour. \"The Science of Selling Yourself Short\" was released as the album's second single in July 2003. Outtakes from the sessions were released as the compilation album B Is for B-Sides (2004).",

    "wikiDesc": "All About Chemistry is the third and most recent studio album by American rock band Semisonic, released on March 13, 2001, through MCA Records. With this release, the band failed, at least in America, to capitalize on the momentum it had generated with the song \"Closing Time\" from their previous album, Feeling Strangely Fine. This had a softer edge than Feeling Strangely Fine and was not as popular with the fans. By 2002, the album had sold 58,000 copies, and its poor sales partially led to the band going on an unofficial hiatus. However, it has a five star rating by Q Magazine. The track \"Chemistry\" was featured on the soundtrack for 40 Days and 40 Nights.\nThe song \"One True Love\" was co-written by the band's singer/guitarist, Dan Wilson and music legend Carole King. The song \"Get a Grip\" is an ode to masturbation. The title track was included on the album \"Nolee Mix\" which was released to promote the My Scene dolls.\nThe special edition of the album features cover art with orange (or pink in the UK) fluid in the vials instead of the blue fluid of the original. It includes two bonus tracks, \"Girlfriend\" and \"Ordinary Life\"; instead of being tacked onto the end, they appear between \"Get a Grip\" and \"Surprise.\"",

It was recorded from 1970 to 1971 at Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, California and released later that year on November 1 by Epic Records. The recording was dominated by band frontman/songwriter Sly Stone during a period of escalated drug use and intra-group tension.\nWith the album, Sly and the Family Stone departed from the optimistic sound of their previous music and explored a darker, more challenging sound featuring edgy funk rhythms, primitive drum machine, extensive overdubbing, and a dense mix. Conceptually and lyrically, There's a Riot Goin' On embraced apathy, pessimism, and disillusionment with both Stone's fame and 1960s counterculture amid a turbulent political climate in the United States at the turn of the 1970s, influenced by the decline of the civil rights movement and the rise of the Black Power movement. The album's title was originally planned to be Africa Talks to You, but it changed in response to Marvin Gaye's album What's Going On, released six months before Riot.",

At this point, the band had collapsed into a trio, without a full-time drummer, but leader Bill Henderson and guitarist/keyboardist/drummer Brian MacLeod had become a powerful songwriting team during the interim.  The single release \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\"  became the group's first hit since the 1979 collapse of their former label Mushroom Records, reaching #1 in Canada and giving Chilliwack their U.S. Top 40 breakthrough peaking at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100: \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\" also gave Chilliwack their only evident chart item outside North America reaching #57 in Australia with a disproportionately long chart run of 28 weeks. The success of \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\" led to a touring version of Chilliwack re-forming. The album's second single: \"I Believe\", released in early 1982, was also a Top 10 Canadian hit and returned Chilliwack to the U.S. Top 40 at #33. In November 1982, Wanna Be a Star was certified Platinum (in excess of 100,000 copies sold) in Canada.Overall the album is something of a concept album about the \"rock and roll\" lifestyle and the pursuit of fame. The leadoff track \"Sign Here\" is a reference to Chilliwack's new quest for mainstream success, tempered by their brush with fame on Mushroom.  This was the first album they recorded with Solid Gold Records in Canada, a new Toronto-based label.",

They released three more albums—One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This (2006), Cause I Sez So (2009) and Dancing Backward in High Heels (2011).[1] Following a 2011 British tour with Alice Cooper, the band once again disbanded.[2]",

    "albumArtist": "Van Halen",
    "wikiDesc": "Van Halen was an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California in 1972 by the Dutch-born American brothers Eddie Van Halen (guitar) and Alex Van Halen (drums), plus singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony. The band's discography consists of 12 studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, and 56 singles.\nThe band signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1977, and in the following year released the album Van Halen. Over the next few years, the band alternated album releases, one per year between 1979 and 1982, and touring to increasing commercial and critical acclaim, becoming one of the world's most successful and influential rock bands. In 1984, Van Halen released 1984, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and had the band's sole No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Jump\". After the tour promoting that album, Roth left the band due to artistic and personal tensions with Eddie.\nTo replace Roth, Eddie picked Sammy Hagar, formerly of Montrose and at that time a very successful solo artist. Van Halen's first album with Hagar, 1986's 5150, was the band's first No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The three studio albums that succeeded, OU812, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and Balance, also topped the charts. In 1996, Hagar left Van Halen amidst similar tension with the Van Halen brothers.\nRoth rejoined briefly and recorded two songs with the band for the 1996 compilation Best Of – Volume I, but Van Halen eventually settled on Gary Cherone, frontman of the then defunct Boston-based band Extreme. Cherone's sole release with the band was Van Halen III, released in 1998 to mixed reviews and diminishing sales, being the only Van Halen studio album not to get a platinum RIAA certification. Van Halen's last release for Warner was the 2004 compilation Best of Both Worlds, which featured three new songs with Hagar. In 2011, the band left the label and signed with Interscope Records.In February 2012, Van Halen released its 12th studio album and first for Interscope, A Different Kind of Truth, featuring Roth on vocals and Eddie's son Wolfgang on bass guitar. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, and became the band's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart with a sixth spot.As of 2007, Van Halen has sold 75 million albums worldwide  and have thirteen No. 1 hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. During the 1980s, they, along with the band Heart, had more Billboard Hot 100 hits, fifteen, than any other hard rock or heavy metal band. According to the RIAA, Van Halen is the 19th best-selling music group/artist of all time with sales of over 56 million albums in the US, and is one of five rock bands that have had two albums (Van Halen and 1984) sell more than ten million copies in the US.",

Flood was the duo's first album on the major label Elektra Records. It generated three singles: \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\", \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\", and the domestic promotional track \"Twisting\". The album is generally considered to be the band's definitive release, as it is their best-selling and most recognizable album. Despite minimal stylistic and instrumental differences from previous releases, Flood is distinguished by contributions from seasoned producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. John Linnell and John Flansburgh also took advantage of new equipment and recording techniques, including unconventional, home-recorded samples, which were programmed through Casio FZ-1 synthesizers. The album was recorded in New York City at Skyline Studios, which was better equipped than studios the band had worked in previously.\nPromotion for Flood included television appearances, promotional videos, and an international tour. The album's mainstream promotion and success contributed to its status as the band's most well known album. Many fans, including young viewers of Tiny Toon Adventures, were first exposed to They Might Be Giants's music through Flood.\nThe album was initially issued on CD, LP, and cassette. Upon its release, Flood was met with praise from critics and achieved moderate success on sales charts. In 2013, the album was reissued as part of a CD series spanning They Might Be Giants' four Elektra releases. In 2014, it was reissued on LP in Europe by Music On Vinyl and in the United States by Asbestos Records for Record Store Day and Black Friday, and it was reissued again on LP in 2015 on the band's label, Idlewild Recordings.",

It was produced by the band and Roy Thomas Baker, and launched Queen to mainstream popularity in the UK and throughout the world.\nThe album's first single \"Killer Queen\" reached number 2 in the British charts and provided the band with their first top 20 hit in the US, peaking at number 12 on the Billboard singles chart. Sheer Heart Attack was the first Queen album to hit the US top 20, peaking at number 12 in 1975. It has been acknowledged for containing \"a wealth of outstanding hard rock guitar tracks\". Retrospectively, it has been listed by multiple publications as one of the band's best works and has been deemed an essential glam rock album.",

    "albumArtist": "The Kinks",
    "wikiDesc": "The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \"You Really Got Me\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.The Kinks' music drew from a wide range of influences, including American R&B and rock and roll initially, and later adopting British music hall, folk, and country. The band gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and made apparent in albums such as Face to Face (1966), Something Else (1967), The Village Green Preservation Society (1968), Arthur (1969), Lola Versus Powerman (1970), and Muswell Hillbillies (1971), along with their accompanying singles including the transatlantic hit \"Lola\" (1970). After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums Sleepwalker (1977), Misfits (1978), Low Budget (1979), Give the People What They Want (1981) and State of Confusion (1983), the last of which produced one of the band's most successful US hits, \"Come Dancing\". In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Romantics covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence.The original line-up comprised Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals), Mick Avory (drums, percussion) and Pete Quaife (bass). The Davies brothers remained with the band throughout its history. Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, with keyboardist John Gosling being added in 1970 (prior to this, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins played on many of their recordings). After Dalton's 1976 departure, Andy Pyle briefly served as the band's bassist before being replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Gosling quit in 1978 and was first replaced by ex-Pretty Things member Gordon Edwards, then more permanently by Ian Gibbons in 1979. Avory left the group in 1984 and was replaced by another Argent member Bob Henrit. The band gave its last public performance in 1996 and broke up in 1997 as a result of creative tension between the Davies brothers.The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, they have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four Kinks albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\". In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. In 2018, after years of ruling out a reunion due to the brothers' animosity and the difficult relationship between longtime drummer Mick Avory and Dave, Ray and Dave Davies finally announced they were working to reform the Kinks, with Avory also on board. However, comments made by each of the Davies brothers in 2020 and 2021 would indicate that in the years since the initial announcement, little (if any) progress has been made towards an actual Kinks reunion for a new studio band album. In 2023, Avory confirmed that the reunion would no longer be taking place due to conflicting opinions of direction between the Davies brothers.",

Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history at the time of its release, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won Best British Album at the 2008 Brit Awards. They went on to release Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011). \nThe band's wider international fame came with the success of their critically acclaimed fifth album AM (2013), which was supported by the global hit \"Do I Wanna Know?\". It topped four Billboard charts and was certified platinum in the US. At the 2014 Brit Awards, the album became their third to win British Album of the Year. Their sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. It received a Best Alternative Music Album nomination at the 2019 Grammy Awards, their second to do so after Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. Their seventh album, The Car, was released in 2022, and received nominations for the Ivor Novello Awards and the Mercury Prize in 2023. \nIn the United Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums. The band have won seven Brit Awards; winning Best British Group and British Album of the Year three times, becoming the first band to ever \"do the double\" —that is, win in both categories— three times; a Mercury Prize for Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, an Ivor Novello Award, and 20 NME Awards. In addition, they have been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and received Mercury Prize nominations in 2007, 2013, 2018 and 2023. Both Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not and AM are included in NME's and different editions of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists.",

It features Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Gilmour's fiancée, the novelist Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the lyrics, which deal with themes of communication. It was the last Pink Floyd studio album to be composed of entirely new material, and the last recorded with Wright, who died in 2008.\nRecording took place in locations including the band's Britannia Row Studios and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria. The production team included longtime Pink Floyd collaborators such as producer Bob Ezrin, engineer Andy Jackson, saxophonist Dick Parry and bassist Guy Pratt.\nThe Division Bell received mixed reviews, but reached number one in more than 10 countries, including the UK and the US. In the US, it was certified double platinum in 1994 and triple platinum in 1999. Pink Floyd promoted it with a tour of the US and Europe; the tour sold more than 5 million tickets and made around $100 million in gross income. A live album and video, Pulse, was released in 1995. Some of the unused material from the Division Bell sessions became part of Pink Floyd's next album, The Endless River (2014).\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "The Fragile is the third studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as a double album by Nothing Records and Interscope Records on September 21, 1999. It was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and English producer Alan Moulder, a longtime Reznor collaborator. It was recorded throughout 1997 to 1999 in New Orleans.\nLooking to depart from the distorted production of their previous album, The Downward Spiral (1994), the album features elements of ambient and electronic music within a wide variety of genres. The album continues some of the lyrical themes from The Downward Spiral, including depression and drug abuse. The album notably contains more instrumental sections than their previous work, with some entire tracks being instrumentals. The Fragile is also one of the band's longest studio releases, clocking in at nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes long. The record was promoted with three singles: \"The Day the World Went Away\", \"We're in This Together\", and \"Into the Void\", as well as the promotional single \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and an accompanying tour, the Fragility Tour, which spanned two legs. Several accompanying recordings were also released, including a remix album, Things Falling Apart (2000), a live album, And All That Could Have Been (2002), as well as an alternate version of the record, The Fragile: Deviations 1 (2016).\nUpon release, critics applauded the album's ambition and composition, although some criticized its length and perceived lack of lyrical substance. However, in the years following its release, it has come to be regarded by many critics and listeners to be among the band's best work, with some critics who initially gave the album negative reviews writing new reviews praising the album and its impact. The album debuted at number one in the U.S. to become the band's first chart-topper, and was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Discovery is the second studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 12 March 2001 by Virgin Records. It marked a shift from the Chicago house of their first album, Homework (1997), to a house style more heavily inspired by disco, post-disco, garage house, and R&B. Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk described Discovery as an exploration of song structures, musical forms and childhood nostalgia, compared to the \"raw\" electronic music of Homework.\nDiscovery was recorded at Bangalter's home in Paris between 1998 and 2000. It features extensive sampling; some samples are from older records, while others were recorded by Daft Punk playing instruments. The electronic musicians Romanthony, Todd Edwards, and DJ Sneak collaborated on some tracks. For the music videos, Daft Punk developed a concept involving the merging of science fiction with the entertainment industry. Inspired by their childhood love for Japanese anime, the duo collaborated with Leiji Matsumoto to produce Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, an anime film with the entirety of Discovery as the soundtrack.\nBefore Discovery's release, Daft Punk adopted robot costumes. They also launched Daft Club, a website which featured exclusive tracks and other bonus material. Discovery was a critical and commercial success, peaking high across several charts internationally on release. Critics praised Daft Punk for innovating in house music as they had done with Homework. The album produced six singles; \"One More Time\" was its most successful, and became a club hit. In 2020, Rolling Stone included Discovery at number 236 in its updated list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK and Capitol Records in the US. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\nThe record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many of the sonic aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon centers on the idea of madness, exploring themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic  spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles, \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is among the most critically acclaimed albums and often features in professional listings of the greatest of all time. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. The Dark Side of the Moon is certified 14 times platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 983 weeks. As of 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of the 1970s and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.",

They are known for exploring multiple genres, staging energetic live shows, and building a prolific discography.\nThe band's early releases blended surf music and garage rock and were released on their label, Flightless. They released several psychedelic and progressive rock albums in the early 2010s, and incorporated a broader range of musical styles later in the decade, such as jazz fusion on Quarters! and the folk-inspired Paper Mâché Dream Balloon. In 2016, they generated more mainstream attention with Nonagon Infinity, which won the ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album.In 2017, the band fulfilled a promise to release five studio albums within the year, and also marked the beginning of a trilogy of microtonal albums with Flying Microtonal Banana. Subsequent releases integrated heavy metal, synth-pop and progressive rock, and feature lyrics that address environmental themes and a connected fictional universe termed the \"Gizzverse\" by fans. Eric Moore, the second drummer and manager, left in 2020. Since 2019, the band has produced several albums per year, including releasing five in 2022 with three of the releases in that October. Their 25th and most recent album, The Silver Cord, was released in 2023.\nIn a 2019 study conducted by the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard were ranked No. 21 on a list of the world's hardest-working musicians. This was earned due to the number of live shows they played from January 2018 to August 2019—totaling 113 live performances both domestically and internationally.",

During this period, interest in Endtroducing began to build among the American music press, and it peaked at number 37 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart.\nEndtroducing was ranked highly on various lists of the best albums of 1996, and has been acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. It is considered a landmark recording in instrumental hip hop, with DJ Shadow's sampling techniques and arrangements leaving a lasting influence.

    "wikiDesc": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart. It usually appears after a significant stressor, either physical or emotional; when caused by the latter, the condition is sometimes called broken heart syndrome. Examples of physical stressors that can cause TTS are sepsis, shock, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pheochromocytoma. Emotional stressors include bereavement, divorce, or the loss of a job. Reviews suggest that of patients diagnosed with the condition, about 70–80% recently experienced a major stressor, including 41–50% with a physical stressor and 26–30% with an emotional stressor. TTS can also appear in patients who have not experienced major stressors.The pathophysiology is not well understood, but a sudden massive surge of catecholamines such as adrenaline and norepinephrine from extreme stress or a tumor secreting these chemicals is thought to play a central role.  Excess catecholamines, when released directly by nerves that stimulate cardiac muscle cells, have a toxic effect and can lead to decreased cardiac muscular function or \"stunning\". Further, this adrenaline surge triggers the arteries to tighten, thereby raising blood pressure and placing more stress on the heart, and may lead to spasm of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This impairs the arteries from delivering adequate blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. Together, these events can lead to congestive heart failure and decrease the heart's output of blood with each squeeze.Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs worldwide. The condition is thought to be responsible for 2% of all acute coronary syndrome cases presenting to hospitals. Although TTS has generally been considered a self-limiting disease, spontaneously resolving over the course of days to weeks, contemporary observations show that \"a subset of TTS patients may present with symptoms arising from its complications, e.g. heart failure, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest\". This does not imply that rates of shock/death of TTS are comparable to those of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but that patients with acute complications may co-occur with TTS.  These cases of shock and death have been associated with the occurrence of TTS secondary to an inciting physical stressor such as hemorrhage, brain injury sepsis, pulmonary embolism or severe COPD.It occurs more commonly in postmenopausal women. The name \"takotsubo\" comes from the Japanese word takotsubo \"octopus trap\", because the left ventricle of the heart takes on a shape resembling an octopus trap when affected by this condition.A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in October 2021 found a steady annual increase in takotsubo cardiomyopathy among both women and men from 2006 to 2017, with the sharpest increases among women 50 and older.",

    "wikiDesc": "Cowboy Bebop (Japanese: カウボーイビバップ, Hepburn: Kaubōi Bibappu) is a Japanese neo-noir space Western anime television series which aired on TV Tokyo and Wowow from 1998 to 1999. It was created and animated by Sunrise, led by a production team of director Shinichirō Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno, who are collectively billed as Hajime Yatate.\nThe series, which ran for twenty-six episodes (dubbed \"sessions\"), is set in the year 2071, and follows the lives of a traveling bounty-hunting crew aboard a spaceship, the Bebop. Although it incorporates a wide variety of genres, the series draws most heavily from science fiction, Western, and noir films. Its most prominent themes are existential boredom, loneliness, and the inability to escape one's past.\nThe series was dubbed into English by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions, and was originally licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment (and is now licensed by Crunchyroll) and in Britain by Beez Entertainment (now by Anime Limited); Madman Entertainment owns the license in Australia and New Zealand. In 2001, it became the first anime title to be broadcast on Adult Swim.\nCowboy Bebop has been hailed as one of the best animated television series of all time. It was a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets, most notably in the United States. It garnered several major anime and science-fiction awards upon its release, and received acclaim from critics and audiences for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. The English dub was particularly lauded and is regarded as one of the best anime English dubs. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, Cowboy Bebop has also been called a gateway series for anime as a whole.",

Maroon debuted at No. 1 in Canada (their second to reach No. 1 after their 1992's debut Gordon) and No. 5 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In its first week, the album sold 17,800 copies in Canada and just under 128,000 in the U.S. It has sold at least 1 million copies in the U.S. alone. The album spawned three hit singles : \"Pinch Me\", \"Too Little Too Late\" and \"Falling for the First Time\".\nUnlike past albums, the songs came almost entirely from the pairing of Page/Robertson. One track, \"Baby Seat\", was written by Page with longtime songwriting partner, Stephen Duffy. This was the last Page/Duffy track that Barenaked Ladies would release, starting a policy of keeping the writing within the band on their next album. \"Hidden Sun\", written while Hearn was in the hospital, appears as a hidden track on most copies of the album. As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, \"Humour of the Situation\", completely naked.\nThe band recorded 17 tracks for the album; Tracks recorded for this album but omitted from the finished record include: \"Powder Blue\" (appears on the US \"Pinch Me\" single), \"Inline Bowline\" (appears as an extra track on some international versions, and is on the Australian \"Pinch Me\" single), \"Born Human\" (appears on the Australian \"Pinch Me\" single, re-recorded for Hearn's album Night Light) and \"Half a Heart\" (re-recorded for the Barenaked Ladies Are Me sessions before the Maroon sessions version was later released on Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before!). \"That's All, That's All\" was also written for the album, and was later recorded for Page's The Vanity Project.\nThe album was the first Barenaked Ladies album released on DVD-Audio in a 5.1 surround sound mix. In 2020, a 20th Anniversary Edition was released digitally, and was announced for a vinyl release in early 2021. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes contains the three contemporary B-sides recorded for the album (not including \"Half a Heart\") as well as a demo version of \"Falling for the First Time\", and a previously unreleased \"alternate\" version of \"Green Christmas\".

    "wikiDesc": "An album is a collection of audio recordings (e.g., music) issued on a medium such as compact disc (CD), vinyl (record), audio tape (like 8-track or cassette), or digital. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photo album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm.\nThe album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983, being gradually supplanted by the cassette tape throughout the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s before sharply declining during the 1990s. The cassette had largely disappeared by the first decade of the 2000s.\nMost albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or \"mixed\" together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed \"live\", even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some \"live rooms\", have reverberation, which creates a \"live\" sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track.\nAlbum covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term \"album\" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage, the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an \"album\"; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.",

Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast by a fictitious station called \"KNTRY Radio Texas\", with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell, and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature lesser-known Black country artists such as Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, Shaboozey, and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Jon Batiste, Gary Clark Jr., and Rhiannon Giddens.\nCowboy Carter was met with widespread acclaim upon release; critics felt that the album's genre experimentation, expansive scope, and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of their Black roots. The album ignited discussions on Black musicians' place within country music, boosted the listenership of Black country artists and country radio in general, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture.\nCowboy Carter debuted at number one in various countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and broke several chart and streaming records. In the United States, Cowboy Carter became Beyoncé's eighth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the first album by a black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. Two co-lead singles—\"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\"—supported the album, with the former becoming Beyoncé's ninth number one single in the United States and the first country song by a Black woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.  \"II Most Wanted\", a duet with Miley Cyrus, was released as the third single.\n\n",

The album was co-produced with Jack Clement and recorded at Glaser Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, between February and July 1974.\nFollowing the 1972 renewal of his contract with RCA Records, Jennings gained artistic freedom, started to produce his own records, and changed his image to one inspired by the ongoing outlaw movement. Jennings recorded the critically acclaimed Honky Tonk Heroes and the commercial success This Time.\nJennings left the recording studios of RCA and moved his operation to the Glaser Sound Studio. After producer Clement married Jennings' sister-in-law and they became acquainted, Jennings was inspired to record an album upon hearing Allen Reynolds singing \"Dreaming My Dreams with You\" during a demo session hosted by Clement. Upon its release, the album received highly positive reviews from publications such as Rolling Stone, with critics praising the choice of songs and Jennings' vocals.\nDreaming My Dreams was released in June 1975; it topped the country albums chart and peaked at number forty-nine on the Billboard's Top LPs & Tapes.

It is notable for its acoustic bluegrass sound, which stands in contrast with their previous two country pop albums.\nThe group was promoting the album when lead singer Natalie Maines made controversial comments about U.S. President George W. Bush criticizing his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The album's third single, \"Travelin' Soldier\", was #1 on the Billboard Country Chart the week that Maines' comments hit the press.

To this end, they enlisted their first outside collaborator to mix the album—Chris Walla, best known for his work with Death Cab for Cutie.\nMuch of the album was tracked at two upstate New York locations, with some remote work necessary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lyrics on the album touch on those hardships, but mainly center on environmental issues and governmental inaction. Its palindromic title returns to the band's interest in symmetry, with its green-colored artwork harkening back to its ecological themes.

The album was primarily produced by Russell Simmons and Larry Smith.\nThe album was considered groundbreaking for its time, presenting a tougher, more hardcore form of rap. The album's sparse beats and aggressive rhymes were in sharp contrast with the light, party-oriented sound that was popular in contemporary hip hop. With the album, Run-D.M.C. came to be regarded by music critics as pioneering the movement of new-school hip hop of the mid-1980s. Five singles were released in support of it: \"It's Like That\", \"Hard Times\", \"Rock Box\", \"30 Days\" and \"Hollis Crew\". The first single from the album, \"It's Like That\", released on August 10, 1983, expanded lyrical boundaries in rap with its tone of social protest (unemployment, inflation). \"It's Like That\" is considered by many to be the first hardcore rap song, and the first new-school hip hop recording. \"Sucker M.C.'s\" is one of the first diss tracks, and \"Rock Box\" is the first song in the rap rock genre.\nRun-D.M.C. peaked at number 53 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 14 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album became the first rap album to achieve a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) (December 17, 1984). It was released to critical acclaim, and continues to be highly regarded as a seminal hip hop album. In 1989, it was ranked number 51 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 240 on the same magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", with the ranking changing to numbers 242 and 378 in the 2012 and 2020 updates of the list, respectively. The album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003. An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2005 and contained 4 previously unreleased songs.",

The album became the first rap LP to top the Billboard 200 chart, and was the second rap album to be certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is one of Columbia Records' fastest-selling debut records to date and was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2015 for shipping over ten million copies in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its unique musical style, chemistry between the group members, and their stylized rapping. Since its release, Licensed to Ill has been ranked by critics as one of the greatest hip hop and debut albums of all time.\nDespite its popularity and success, this would be the group’s only album to be released from Def Jam due to creative differences with producer Rick Rubin, resulting in the group leaving the label to sign with Capitol Records for their next album, Paul's Boutique (1989).\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "American rock and roll musician Chuck Berry's discography includes 20 studio albums, 12 live albums, 31 compilation albums, 50 singles,  8 EPs, and 2 soundtrack albums.\nBerry's recording career began in 1955, with the release of his single \"Maybellene\", and spanned a total of 62 years, although the latter 4 decades featured few or no releases. His most prolific and successful period spanned the 1950s and early 1960s, during which time he recorded for Chess. By 1960 he had released most of his hits, including \"Maybellene\", \"Roll Over Beethoven\", \"Sweet Little Sixteen\", and \"Johnny B. Goode\". Legal troubles, resulting in his imprisonment in 1961, caused a reduction in his output, but his release in 1963, combined with an interest in his songs thanks to the British invasion, rejuvenated his career. By the time Berry left Chess in 1966, he had released 36 singles, 5 EPs, and 12 albums, including the fake live album, Chuck Berry On Stage and 2 compilation albums, as well as having featured in the soundtrack album for the film Rock, Rock, Rock!.\nBerry subsequently signed to Mercury Records, where he stayed until 1970. During his tenure at Mercury, he released 5 albums, including his first real live album, as well as 5 singles, before he returned to Chess, where he released a further 5 singles and albums each, including The London Chuck Berry Sessions, which became his best-selling album, supported by his only #1 single, \"My Ding-a-Ling\". After his release from Chess in 1975, Berry's releases became sporadic, briefly recording for Atco in 1979, resulting in his final studio album released during his life, Rockit. His final, posthumous, studio album was 2017's Chuck.\nBerry's discography includes a large amount of unofficial live albums, as he performed without being signed to any label for most of his latter years, as well as a number of re-packaged or unofficial compilation albums, owing to Chess Records complicated ownership history.\nOverseas, Berry's discography differed from that in the US, most notably in the UK, where his early work was released mostly by London Records until 1960, then Pye Records until 1965, before being issued directly by Chess or Mercury. This resulted in a number of exclusive British EP releases on the one hand, and a number of unissued LPs and singles on the other.\nIn the US, Berry saw a total of 25 charting singles and 4 charting B-sides, as well as 5 charting albums. Of these, 2 singles have been certified Platinum by the RIAA, as well as 1 Gold single and 1 Gold album.",

The album's production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the band, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sexuality. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of making love and keeping faith.\nOn 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley's life in which his chest was grazed and his arm was struck with a bullet, but he survived. Following the assassination attempt, Marley left Jamaica and was exiled to London, where Exodus was recorded.\nThe album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom. In 2017, Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. There are more tracks from Exodus on Marley’s greatest hits compilation Legend than from any of his other records. Exodus was his tenth album since the debut album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, including the live album Live! (1975).\n\n",

Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5's only single, \"I Want You Back\", became a number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 within weeks of the album's release. The album reached number 5 on the US Pop Albums chart, and spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the US R&B/Black Albums charts. To date, the Jackson 5's debut album has sold estimated 5 million copies worldwide. \nThe album title suggested that Motown star Diana Ross had discovered the group, as do the Ross-penned liner notes on the back cover. Ross' supposed discovery of the Jackson 5 was in fact part of Motown's marketing and promotions plan for the Jackson 5. In actuality, it had been Motown producer Bobby Taylor who had discovered them. Joe Jackson, the father and manager of the Jackson 5, thanked the \"lovely Gladys Knight, (who) extended a helping hand to our family, by calling Motown executives and talking their ear off to take time out of their schedule and meet with us. She believed in us before others. Always grateful to her.\" Knight also said she brought the Jackson 5 to Motown's attention. Regardless, Ross embraced her assigned role and helped promote the group, especially grooming young Michael Jackson as a star.",

    "wikiDesc": "The Velvet Underground & Nico is the debut studio album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground and the German singer Nico. Released by Verve Records in March 1967, the album underperformed in sales and polarized critics upon release due to its abrasive, unconventional sound and controversial lyrical content. It later became regarded as one of the most influential albums in rock and pop music and one of the greatest albums of all time.\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico was recorded in 1966 while the band were featured on Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable tour. Warhol, who designed the album's record sleeve, co-produced with Tom Wilson. The album features elements of avant-garde music incorporated into brash, minimal and groove-driven rock music. The singer, Lou Reed, delivers explicit lyrics spanning themes of drug abuse, prostitution, sadomasochism and urban life. Characterized as \"the original art-rock record\", it was a major influence on many subgenres of rock and alternative music, including punk, garage rock, krautrock, post-punk, post-rock, noise rock, shoegaze, gothic rock, and indie rock. In 1982, the English musician Brian Eno said that while the album only sold approximately 30,000 copies in its first five years, \"everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\".\nThe album was ranked number 13 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003, re-positioned to number 23 on the 2020 updated list. In 2006, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars — Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, the Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics discuss the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\".\nPreceded by the single \"Starman\", Ziggy Stardust reached top five of the UK Albums Chart. Critics responded favourably; some praised the musicality and concept while others struggled to comprehend it. Shortly after its release, Bowie performed \"Starman\" on Britain's Top of the Pops in early July 1972, which propelled him to stardom. The Ziggy character was retained for the subsequent Ziggy Stardust Tour, performances from which have appeared on live albums and a concert film. Bowie described the follow-up album, Aladdin Sane, as \"Ziggy goes to America\".\nIn later decades, Ziggy Stardust has been considered one of Bowie's best works, appearing on numerous professional lists of the greatest albums of all time. Bowie had ideas for a musical based on the album, although this project never came to fruition; ideas were later used for Diamond Dogs (1974). Ziggy Stardust has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2012 for its 40th anniversary. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n",

    "albumArtist": "Nirvana",
    "wikiDesc": "Nevermind is the second studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. It was Nirvana's first release on a major label and the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work. It was recorded at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, in May and June 1991, and mastered that August at the Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California.\nWritten primarily by frontman Kurt Cobain, Nevermind is noted for channeling a range of emotions, being noted as dark, humorous, and disturbing. It includes anti-establishment views, anti-sexism, frustration, alienation, and troubled love inspired by Cobain's broken relationship with Bikini Kill's Tobi Vail. Contrary to the popular hedonistic themes of drugs and sex at the time, writers have observed that Nevermind promoted the image of the sensitive artist in mainstream rock. According to Cobain, the sound of the album was influenced by bands such as Pixies, R.E.M., the Smithereens, and Melvins. Though the album is considered a cornerstone of the grunge genre, it is noted for its musical diversity, which includes acoustic ballads (\"Polly\" and \"Something in the Way\") and punk-inspired hard rock (\"Territorial Pissings\" and \"Stay Away\").\nNevermind became an unexpected critical and commercial success, reaching the top 10 on charts across the world. On January 11, 1992, it knocked Michael Jackson's Dangerous out of the number one spot on the US Billboard 200 and was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. The lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 and went on to be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Its music video was also heavily rotated on MTV. Three other successful singles were released: \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", and \"In Bloom\". The album was voted the best album of the year in Pazz & Jop critics' poll, while \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" also topped the single-of-the-year and video-of-the-year polls. The album also garnered the band three Grammy Award nominations in total across the 34th and 35th Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album.\nNevermind thrust Nirvana into worldwide superstardom, with Cobain being dubbed the \"voice of his generation\". It brought grunge and alternative rock to a mainstream audience while accelerating the decline of hair metal, drawing similarities to the early 1960s British Invasion of American popular music. It is also often credited with initiating a resurgence of interest in punk culture among teenagers and young adults of Generation X, becoming seminal to the counterculture of the decade. It has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In March 1999, it was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Among the most acclaimed and influential albums in the history of music, Nevermind was added by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry in 2004 for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and is frequently ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time, including being ranked number six on Rolling Stone's 2020 and 2023 lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album has since been reissued with alternate takes and live performances.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols is the only studio album by English punk rock band the Sex Pistols, released on 28 October 1977 through Virgin Records in the UK and on 11 November 1977 through Warner Bros. Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols' volatile internal relationships, the band's lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.\nThe album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever.",

    "wikiDesc": "Departure is the sixth studio album by American rock band Journey. It was released on February 29, 1980, by Columbia Records.\nDeparture was Journey's highest-charting album to that point, giving them their first appearance in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album charts, peaking at No. 8. The album includes \"Any Way You Want It\", the leadoff track and top 25 single.\nThe album featured an edgier sound, thanks partly to the \"live in studio\" way the songs were recorded. The band went into The Automatt studio with 19 tracks, eventually trimming down to 12.\nThree singles were released off Departure.  \"Any Way You Want It\" reached #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the follow-up \"Walks Like a Lady\" reached #32. The last single was a medley of \"Good Morning Girl\" and \"Stay Awhile\" which only reached #55. Record World called the medley \"an epic ballad\" with \"healthy amounts of pomp and bravado.\"\nDeparture would mark the last full-time studio album appearance of founding member Gregg Rolie, and his penultimate recording with the band: his final contributions would appear on Dream, After Dream, a soundtrack album to the Japanese film of the same name, which would also be released in 1980. Rolie had become tired of life on the road and decided to leave the band after assisting in the selection of his replacement, Jonathan Cain, then of The Babys. Rolie sang lead vocals on only one song on Departure, the ballad \"Someday Soon\".\nIn 1986, Columbia reissued Departure on compact disc in the U.S. and Europe. They subsequently remastered the album in 1996. BMG/Columbia remastered Departure again in 2006 for European, Japanese and American listeners, adding bonus tracks 13 \"Natural Thing\" and 14 \"Little Girl\".  Dave Donnelly at DNA Mastering in New York City led the 2006 project.",

    "wikiDesc": "Doolittle, the second studio album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, was released on April 17, 1989, on 4AD records. The album was an instant critical success and became the band's breakthrough album. Doolittle was especially well received in Europe, where the British music weeklies Melody Maker and Sounds named it their album of the year. Pixies' main songwriter and lead vocalist Black Francis wrote the idiosyncratic lyrics, which allude to surrealist imagery, biblical violence, and descriptions of torture and death.\nThe album is praised for its \"quiet/loud\" dynamic, which was achieved through subdued verses that are founded on Kim Deal's bass patterns and David Lovering's drums. The peaks in tone and volume were achieved through the addition of distorted guitars by Francis and Joey Santiago. This technique influenced the development of early-1990s grunge music; Kurt Cobain said Doolittle was one of his favorite records and that its songs heavily influenced Nirvana's song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".\nUpon its release, Doolittle reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart. It has sold consistently since its release, and numerous music publications have placed it among the top albums of the 1980s. Both singles from the album, \"Here Comes Your Man\" and \"Monkey Gone to Heaven\", reached the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, while many of the album's tracks, including \"Debaser\" and \"Hey\", remain favorites of critics and fans.\n\n",

It was the band's first album under their new record label Big Brother Recordings.  In the year preceding the album's release, Alan McGee closed Creation Records, and Oasis had lost two founding members (Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan) and hired new producer Mark \"Spike\" Stent to replace Owen Morris.\nThe album marked a significant change from the Britpop scene to a modern psychedelic record complete with drum loops, samples, electric sitar, Mellotron, synthesisers and backward guitars, resulting in an album more experimental with electronica and heavy psychedelic rock influences. Songs such as \"Go Let It Out\", the Indian-influenced \"Who Feels Love?\", and the progressive \"Gas Panic!\" departed from the band's earlier style. This album also marked the first time that lead singer Liam Gallagher contributed on songwriting (\"Little James\"), and this process continued for their subsequent albums, instead of relying solely on Noel Gallagher's songwriting as they had for the first three albums.\nIt is the 16th-fastest-selling album in UK chart history, selling over 310,000 copies in its first week. Standing on the Shoulder of Giants has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry and has sold around 208,000 copies in the US.\n\n",

It is best known for its title track, \"Layla\", which is often regarded as Eric Clapton's greatest musical achievement. The other band members were Bobby Whitlock (vocals, keyboard), Jim Gordon (drums, percussion), and Carl Radle (bass).

It was released on 18 February 1985 by Virgin Records in the UK and by Atlantic and WEA internationally.\nAfter finishing touring commitments with Genesis and working with Eric Clapton in 1984, Collins resumed his solo career and started work on a new album. He made a conscious decision to write more uptempo and dance-oriented songs, as much of his previous material was influenced by matters surrounding his first divorce. The album features Helen Terry, Peter Gabriel, and Sting as guest backing vocalists. Some songs, like \"Don't Lose My Number\" and \"Sussudio\", were based around improvisation, and others, like \"Long Long Way to Go\", had a political message.\nNo Jacket Required was received favourably by the majority of critics and was a huge worldwide commercial success, reaching number one in the UK for five consecutive weeks and for seven non-consecutive weeks in the US. It was the second-best-selling album of 1985 in the UK, behind Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms. \"One More Night\", \"Sussudio\", \"Don't Lose My Number\" and \"Take Me Home\" were released as singles with corresponding music videos. All four were top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with \"Sussudio\" and \"One More Night\" reaching number one. The three singles released in the UK all reached the top 20. Some tracks were featured on the television shows Miami Vice and Cold Case, and \"The Man with the Horn\" was re-written and re-recorded for the episode \"Phil the Shill\".\nIn 2001, No Jacket Required was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 12 million copies in the US and amassed worldwide sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It won three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The No Jacket Required World Tour saw Collins perform 85 concerts which culminated with a performance at both Live Aid shows in London and Philadelphia. Remixes of six songs from the album were released on the compilation 12\"ers (1987). In 2010, it was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the previous 30 years by the Brit Awards. It ranked No. 74 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"Definitive 200\" list. A remastered deluxe edition with updated artwork and bonus tracks was released in 2016.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "There Is Nothing Left to Lose is the third studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on November 2, 1999, through Roswell and RCA Records. It marked the first studio credit for drummer Taylor Hawkins, and is often seen as a departure from the band's previous work, showcasing a softer, more experimental sound. Vocalist and guitarist Dave Grohl has called it his favorite Foo Fighters album, stating that it was \"totally based on melody\" and that the recording process was a serene experience. The album was recorded using only three musicians; Grohl,  Hawkins, and bassist Nate Mendel in the basement of Grohl's home in Alexandria, Virginia. \nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2001, marking the band's first ever Grammy win. The band would go on to win the Grammy for Best Rock Album for three of their next four studio releases (One by One; Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace; and Wasting Light).\nThere Is Nothing Left to Lose is Foo Fighters' first album to be entirely released and marketed by RCA Records since their departure from Capitol Records after the release of The Colour and the Shape two years earlier. Their two previous studio albums, originally distributed by Capitol, were since then distributed by RCA.",

    "wikiDesc": "Enema of the State is the third studio album by American rock band Blink-182, released on June 1, 1999, by MCA Records. After a long series of performances at various clubs and festivals and several indie recordings throughout the 1990s, Blink-182 first achieved popularity on the Warped Tour and in Australia following the release of their second album Dude Ranch (1997) and its rock radio hit \"Dammit.\" To record their third album, Blink-182 turned to veteran punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album Dookie (1994). Enema was the band's first album to feature drummer Travis Barker, who replaced original drummer Scott Raynor.\nThe group recorded with Finn over a period of three months at numerous locations, including their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating a pop-punk sound with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations to craft summer-related tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform; the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.\nEnema of the State was an enormous commercial success, although the band was criticized as synthesized, manufactured pop only remotely resembling punk, and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and associated music videos. The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and catapulted the band to become one of the biggest rock bands of the turn of the millennium. \"What's My Age Again?\", \"All the Small Things\", and \"Adam's Song\" became hit singles and MTV staples, generating heavy radio airplay. Enema of the State has retrospectively been hailed as a quintessential pop-punk album and had an extensive impact on the genre and beyond, reinventing it for a new generation, influencing countless bands and artists, and spawning numerous tributes and accolades.\n\n",

Released as a double album on 24 February 1975 in the United States and on 28 February 1975 in the United Kingdom, it was the group's first album to be released under their new label, Swan Song Records. The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The total playing time covered just under three sides of an LP, so they decided to expand it into a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from the sessions for the band's earlier albums Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971) and Houses of the Holy (1973). The album covered a range of styles including hard rock, progressive rock, rock 'n' roll and folk. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of-year release; however, its release was delayed because the Peter Corriston-designed die-cut album cover proved difficult to manufacture.\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful upon its release and debuted at number one on album charts in the UK and number three in the United States. It was promoted by a successful U.S. tour and a five-night residency at Earl's Court, London. The album has been reissued on CD several times, including an expansive 40th anniversary edition in 2015. Physical Graffiti was later certified 16× platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2006, signifying shipments of over eight million copies in the US.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Random Access Memories is the fourth and final studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 through Columbia Records. It pays tribute to late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the packaging and promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements and a web series. Recording sessions took place from 2008 to 2012 at Henson, Conway and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France.\nFollowing the minimal production of their previous album, Human After All (2005), Daft Punk recruited session musicians with the help of Chris Caswell to perform live instrumentation and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. It combines disco, progressive rock and pop, with contributions by Paul Jackson Jr., Giorgio Moroder, Chilly Gonzales, Julian Casablancas, Paul Williams, Caswell, Pharrell Williams, Nile Rodgers, Todd Edwards, Panda Bear and DJ Falcon.\nRandom Access Memories is the only Daft Punk album to top the US Billboard 200, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also topped the charts in twenty other countries. Its lead single, \"Get Lucky\", topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. The album appeared on several year-end lists, and won in several categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. \"Get Lucky\" also won the awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Random Access Memories  number 295 on their list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\n",

The film features the band performing live in the studio and recording a potential live album, as well as voice-over interviews with the band members. Songs featured include numerous McCartney, Wings and Beatles hits, as well as some covers. Although a TV sales brochure was made, the film and album went unreleased at the time. In the decades since, they have been frequently bootlegged, and various tracks have been released on special editions of other McCartney and Wings albums. The film was finally released on 2 November 2010 as part of the box set reissue of Band on the Run, the first release in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection.\nIt was announced in August 2024 that the film had been remastered in 4K, and was released in cinemas on 26 September 2024.",

With it, the band decided to create \"a classic Dream Theater album\", drawing upon their various stylistic influences while trying to make the music less complex. The album takes its creative concept from the musical octave.\nOctavarium peaked in the top five in the Finnish, Italian, and Swedish charts, and in the top ten in the Dutch, Japanese, and Norwegian charts. Critical reception of the album was generally positive; the diversity of the music was praised, although critics found some of the songwriting to be inconsistent. Dream Theater promoted the album on a year-long world tour, with the majority of concerts lasting almost three hours and featuring a different setlist each night. The tour finished at Radio City Music Hall accompanied by an orchestra; this performance was recorded and released as a live album and concert video entitled Score. They co-headlined the 2005 North American Gigantour with Megadeth.\n\n",

Illinois  is Stevens' second based on a U.S. state—part of a planned series of fifty that began with the 2003 album Michigan and that Stevens has since acknowledged was a joke.  It was adapted into a musical, Illinoise, in 2023 and, after playing smaller venues, opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway in April 2024.\nStevens recorded and produced the album at multiple venues in New York City using low-fidelity studio equipment and a variety of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state—Stevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following its release, Stevens promoted Illinois with a world tour.\nThe album received widespread critical acclaim from music critics for its well-written lyrics and complex orchestrations. In particular, reviewers noted Stevens' progress as a songwriter since the release of Michigan. Illinois was named the best-reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator Metacritic, and was included on several reviewers' \"best of the decade\" lists—including those of Paste, NPR, and Rolling Stone. The album amounted to Stevens' greatest public success to date; it was his first to place on the Billboard 200, and it topped the Billboard list of \"Heatseekers Albums\". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and the Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "Vespertine is the fourth studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk. It was first released on 18 August 2001 in Japan by One Little Indian Records and in the United States by Elektra Entertainment. Björk aspired to create an album with minimal and intricate electronic music to evoke an intimate and domestic feeling, in contrast with the louder styles of her previous studio album Homogenic (1997). She enlisted producers such as Opiate, Console and the duo Matmos, and has also worked with harpist Zeena Parkins. Production on the album began while filming her role in Dancer in the Dark.\nBjörk composed arrangements with thin-sounding instruments, including the harp, the celesta, clavichord, strings and custom music boxes. Assisted by Matmos, Björk created \"microbeats\" from various commonplace sounds, such as that of shuffling cards and ice being cracked. Lyrically, the album drew inspiration from Björk's new relationship with Matthew Barney, exploring themes related to sex, intimacy, eroticism, and love. Other lyrical sources include the poetry of E. E. Cummings and British playwright Sarah Kane's Crave. Three singles were released from Vespertine: \"Hidden Place\", \"Pagan Poetry\", and \"Cocoon\". The music videos of the latter two were banned on MTV for their depictions of sexuality. Björk embarked on the Vespertine world tour with Parkins, Matmos, and a choir of Inuit women, where they performed at theatres and small venues in favor of acoustics.\nThe album peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 selling 75,000 copies in its first week and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Noted for its erotic, intimate mood and sonic experimentation, Vespertine received universal acclaim from music critics, with some considering it Björk's best album to date. The album appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of 2001 and of the decade, and has been evaluated by many critics to be one of the best albums of all time.\n\n",

The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. The Boomtown Rats vocalist Bob Geldof made his film debut as rock star Pink, who, driven to neurosis by the pressures of stardom and traumatic events in his life, constructs an emotional and mental wall to protect himself. However, this coping mechanism eventually backfires, and Pink demands to be set free.\nLike its associated album, the film is highly metaphorical, and frequently uses both visual and auditory symbols throughout its runtime. It features little dialogue, instead being driven by the music from the album throughout. The songs used in the film have several differences from their album versions, and one of the songs included, \"When the Tigers Broke Free\", does not appear on the album. Despite its turbulent production, the film received generally positive reviews and has an established cult following among Pink Floyd fans.",

The lead single \"Can I Play with Madness\" was also a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.\nA concept album inspired by the novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, the record incorporates elements of progressive rock, seen in the length and complex structure of the title track. It was also the first Iron Maiden album to feature keyboards, after the band had introduced non-keyboard synth effects on their previous LP, Somewhere in Time (1986). \nAfter his contributions were rejected for Somewhere in Time, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son features several songs co-written by lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who states that his  enthusiasm for the band was renewed during the album's production stages. It was Iron Maiden's last studio record to feature the Piece of Mind-era lineup until the 2000 album Brave New World, with guitarist Adrian Smith leaving the band in January 1990 after he did not approve of the direction the band were aiming for on their next album No Prayer for the Dying. \nFollowing the album's release, the band embarked on the Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in which Derek Riggs' cover artwork was recreated on stage. The band played over 100 shows, including the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, and recorded the Maiden England video at Birmingham's NEC. From 2012 to 2014, the band revisited the Seventh Son era on their Maiden England World Tour.\n\n",

Produced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails, the album marked a departure from Halsey's previous work, featuring a heavy industrial influence, and was described by Halsey as a concept album about \"the joys and horrors of pregnancy and childbirth\". It was her final album for Capitol, before she parted ways with the label in April 2023.\nLeading up to the release of  If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, a theatrical film directed by American filmmaker Colin Tilley, titled after the album and featuring its music, screened in select IMAX cinemas around the world on August 25 and 26, 2021. The album went on to debut within the top 10 of thirteen sales charts worldwide, including the US Billboard 200, where it became Halsey's fourth consecutive record to debut inside the top two of the chart. Two singles were released to promote the album: \"I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God\", which reached number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"You Asked for This\". In February 2023, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nIf I Can't Have Love, I Want Power received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its ambitious concept and theatrical production. The album was featured in the top 10's of several best-of album lists for 2021, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. The album was supported by the Love and Power Tour.\n\n",

It is Lavigne's first studio release since her self-titled fifth studio album five years prior, marking the longest gap between two of her studio albums, and is her first and only album recorded for the new incarnation of BMG (she was originally signed to the first incarnation of BMG, which later relaunched after Sony’s acquisition of BMG’s former labels). She assumed an integral role in the album's production and collaborated with several producers including Chad Kroeger, Stephan Moccio, Chris Baseford, Johan Carlsson, Lauren Christy from The Matrix, Ryan Cabrera, Travis Clark of We the Kings, Bonnie McKee, J.R. Rotem, and Mitch Allan, among others.\nThe album draws inspiration from Lavigne's battle with Lyme disease, with her describing the album as an \"emotional journey\". The title track was released as the lead single from the album in September 2018, followed by \"Tell Me It's Over\" as the second single in December 2018, \"Dumb Blonde\" as the third single the week of the album's release, a collaboration with rapper Nicki Minaj and \"I Fell in Love with the Devil\" as the fourth single in June 2019.\nHead Above Water received generally mixed reviews from music critics. While some praised Lavigne's vocal performance, themes and maturity compared to the singer's previous works, some noted the \"generic\" sound of the album, criticizing the lyrics and production of certain songs. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard Canadian Albums chart, making it Lavigne's sixth album to enter the top ten in Canada. In the United States the album debuted at number thirteen on the Billboard 200 chart. In the United Kingdom the album debuted and peaked at number ten on the UK Albums OCC chart.\nIn support of the album, Lavigne embarked on the Head Above Water Tour, starting on September 14, 2019 (her first tour in nearly five years following the Avril Lavigne Tour).",

The album was originally set to be released in 2011, following the singles \"17\", \"One\", and \"Obsession\". However, they became commercial failures and caused her label to postpone the album repeatedly. As a result, many recording sessions were held for the album; some of which went towards two extended plays (EP), As If! (2011) and Ghost (2012).\nThe final result includes work from Ferreira and producers including Ariel Rechtshaid, Justin Raisen, and Dan Nigro, which marks a departure from her previously released material. Musically, it is an indie rock and synth-pop album that explores 1980s pop music, 1990s grunge, and various styles of rock, while its lyrics convey themes such as failure, love, and anger. The album cover, shot by film director Gaspar Noé, portrays a topless Ferreira in a shower. Night Time, My Time received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its sound; it has been recognized by numerous media outlets as one of 2013's best albums and was ranked by Pitchfork as number 43 in a list of the 200 best albums of the 2010s. It was a modest success commercially; it debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 45 and on the Australian Albums Chart at number 40.\nNight Time, My Time was preceded by the digital release of its lead single, \"You're Not the One\", accompanied by a music video. Capitol Records also issued \"24 Hours\" and \"Boys\" as free digital promotional singles, and although it was not released as a single, a music video was filmed for the album's title track.",

The album is mostly composed of studio outtakes recorded during the 1970s, and contains one of the band's most well-known songs, \"Start Me Up\", which hit number two on the US Billboard singles charts.\nA combination of touring obligations and personal feuding between band members made it difficult to arrange dedicated recording sessions for the band's follow-up to 1980's Emotional Rescue. As a result, the band's production team combed through unused recordings from prior sessions, some dating back almost a decade.  While a few of the songs were used essentially as-is in their original form, most of these earlier recordings were not complete, consisting of song fragments requiring much work. Studio time was booked throughout 1980 and 1981 and band members came in when available to finish off the tracks.\nThe credited members of the Rolling Stones for the album were vocalist Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts while older tracks feature former Stones guitarist Mick Taylor (\"Tops\"), keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and Billy Preston, Black and Blue session guitarist Wayne Perkins (\"Worried About You\") and founding member Ian Stewart.\nThe album proved to be both a critical and commercial success upon release, reaching the top of the US Billboard 200. To date, it is the final Rolling Stones album to reach the top position of the US charts, concluding the band's string of eight consecutive number-one albums there, dating back to 1971's Sticky Fingers.\nIn 1989, it was ranked No. 34 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 211 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then re-ranked number 213 in the 2012 revised list. Peter Corriston, who was responsible for the album cover's concept origination, art direction and design, won a Grammy Award in the category of Best Album Package.\nA remastered 40th-anniversary edition of the album was released on 22 October 2021. It features nine previously unreleased tracks and a 1982 concert at Wembley Stadium.\n\n",

    "wikiDesc": "From Under the Cork Tree is the second studio album by the American rock band Fall Out Boy, released on May 3, 2005, by Island Records as the band's major label debut. The music was composed by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, with all lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, expanding the band's songwriting approach they took for some songs on their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). Neal Avron served as the album's producer. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about \"the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.\" In support of its release, the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals. For their Black Clouds and Underdogs tour, the album was re-released as From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" Edition), featuring new songs and remixes.\nThe album was Fall Out Boy's breakthrough mainstream success. Spearheaded by the lead single \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\", the album debuted at No. 9 on the US Billboard 200 with 168,000 first week sales, a position it stayed at for two non-consecutive weeks, earning the band their first Top 10 album and becoming their longest charting and best-selling album. It logged 14 weeks in the Top 20 out of its 78 chart weeks. The album as well as its singles won several awards and the album was certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has since sold over 2.5 million units in the United States, and over seven million worldwide. The album produced two hugely popular hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\", which peaked at No. 8 and No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 respectively, receiving regular radio play on both pop and alternative stations.

The band began work on the album in the wake of the cancellation of a European tour after the release of their previous album, Insomniac. Recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, the album was written with the intent of creating a set of standalone songs as opposed to a cohesive album. Retrospectively, Nimrod is noted for its musical diversity and experimentation, containing elements of folk, hardcore, surf rock, and ska. Lyrical themes discussed include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.\nThe album peaked at number ten on the Billboard U.S. charts and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record was also certified triple platinum in Australia and double platinum in Canada. Upon release, Nimrod received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer Billie Joe Armstrong's songwriting. The album yielded the acoustic single \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\", which appeared in numerous popular culture events, including the penultimate episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. To promote the album, Green Day embarked on an extensive touring schedule. The album was also reissued on vinyl on June 16, 2009, as well as for anniversary and deluxe edition releases in 2012, 2017, and 2023. The songs \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\", and \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" are featured in the video game Green Day: Rock Band.\n\n",

    "albumArtist": "Metallica",
    "wikiDesc": "Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand, in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair.\nAlthough rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. Bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the band and had more input in the songwriting. Beyond the fast tempos of its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It is the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from successor Kirk Hammett.\nRide the Lightning received a highly positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with virtually no radio exposure and has since reached number 48. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on thrash metal.\n\n",

The album inspired the Alice Cooper: The Nightmare TV special, a worldwide concert tour, and his Welcome to My Nightmare concert film (1976). The tour was one of the most over-the-top excursions of that era. Most of Lou Reed's band joined Cooper for this record. Internationally, Welcome to My Nightmare was released by the ABC subsidiary Anchor Records.

Rolling Stone would later rank it ninetieth on the list of the \"Top 100 Album Covers of All Time\". Famed horror film star Vincent Price provided a monologue in the song \"Devil's Food\". The song \"Escape\" was a rewrite of a song by the Hollywood Stars from their shelved album Shine Like a Radio – The Great Lost 1974 Album, which was finally released in 2013.

Bridging a traditional punk rock sound and a new wave aesthetic, London Calling reflects the band's growing interest in styles beyond their punk roots, including reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock. Lyrical themes include social displacement, unemployment, racial conflict, drug use, and the responsibilities of adulthood.\nThe album was a top ten chart success in the UK, and its lead single \"London Calling\" was a top 20 single. The album has sold over five million copies worldwide, and was certified platinum in the US for sales of one million. It was also met with widespread critical acclaim and has retrospectively been named one of the greatest albums of all time.

    "albumArtist": "Outkast",
    "wikiDesc": "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is the fifth studio album by the American hip-hop duo Outkast. It was released on September 23, 2003, by Arista Records. Issued as a double album, its length of over two hours is spread across solo records by Big Boi and André 3000.\nOriginally conceived as standalone albums, the members' solo efforts were integrated into a double album under Outkast's name as Arista deemed the decision to release solo albums unsuitable at the time. Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is a Southern hip-hop and progressive rap album influenced by Parliament-Funkadelic, while André 3000's The Love Below largely departs from hip-hop in favor of pop, funk, jazz, psychedelia, and progressive soul styles, drawing inspiration from Prince. While The Love Below was entirely produced by André 3000, Speakerboxxx featured contributions from André 3000, Mr. DJ, Carl Mo, Cutmaster Swift, and Dojo5, in addition to production by Big Boi. Lyrically, Speakerboxxx discusses socially conscious themes, such as single parenthood, philosophy, religion, and politics, whereas The Love Below is centered on complexities related to love and relationships. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below features a multifaceted array of collaborators, including Sleepy Brown, Killer Mike, Ludacris, Jay-Z, Rosario Dawson, Kelis, and Norah Jones.\nSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below received widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised the consistency of Big Boi's Speakerboxxx and the eclectic musical style of André 3000's The Love Below. Numerous publications proclaimed the album as one of the best records of 2003, placing it atop their year-end listings. A commercial success, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below became Outkast's first number-one album on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 509,000 units, and went on to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 2004. At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), the album won Album of the Year and Best Rap Album, becoming only the second hip hop album ever to win the former. It produced five singles, two of which—\"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move\"—topped the US Billboard Hot 100, and made Outkast the first duo in the chart's history to replace themselves at the summit. Furthermore, \"Hey Ya!\" won the Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. \"Roses\" reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well, peaking at number nine, while \"GhettoMusick\" and \"Prototype\" failed to achieve substantial success.\nOutkast heavily promoted Speakerboxxx/The Love Below via interviews and televised performances, often separately, as the album was marketed as a consolidation of Big Boi and André 3000's solo records. The strategy elicited intense media speculation over the duo's disbandment, which the members consistently denied. The musical film Idlewild was originally slated to accompany the album, but was postponed multiple times before being released in 2006, after which Outkast embarked on an extended hiatus. Consequently, a multitude of critics have recognized Speakerboxxx/The Love Below as a signal of Outkast's cessation, but nonetheless hailed the album as one of the best recordings of its era. The album has been further credited for reviving the double album concept in hip-hop, as well as for popularizing conscious hip-hop. Following its RIAA certification update to 13-times platinum in 2023, signifying double-disc units of 6.5 million in the US, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below became the highest-certified rap album of all time. As of September 2023, it has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.",

Winning four out of seven Grammy Awards, it was the most nominations that the band had garnered in their (at the time) 23 year career. Rolling Stone has included the album on its list of Best Albums of the 2000s. Kiedis attributed the album's success to less abrasive dynamics within the band, saying that the band's \"chemistry, when it comes to writing, is better than ever. There was always a struggle to dominate lyrically. But we are now confident enough in who we are, so everybody feels more comfortable contributing more and more valuable, quality stuff.\"\nAfter the culmination of the Stadium Arcadium tour, guitarist John Frusciante left the band in July 2009.  It was his last album with the band until the release of Unlimited Love in 2022, more than a decade later.\n\n",

    "albumArtist": "Bob Dylan",
    "wikiDesc": "Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released as a double album on June 20, 1966, by Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\nBlonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965). Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music.\nThe album peaked at number nine on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" and \"I Want You\". Two additional songs—\"Just Like a Woman\" and \"Visions of Johanna\"—have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list in 2003. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and was ranked number 38 in Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2020.\n\n",

The album was produced by Jimmy Iovine and was released on 10 October 1988, while the film was distributed by Paramount Pictures and was released on 27 October 1988. Following the breakthrough success of the band's previous studio album, The Joshua Tree, the Rattle and Hum project captures their continued experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour, further incorporating elements of blues rock, folk rock, and gospel music into their sound. A collection of new studio tracks, live performances, and cover songs, the project includes recordings at Sun Studio in Memphis and collaborations with Bob Dylan, B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir.\nAlthough Rattle and Hum was intended to represent the band paying tribute to legendary musicians, some critics accused U2 of trying to place themselves amongst the ranks of such artists. Critical reception to both the album and the film was mixed; one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album's \"excitement\"; another described it as \"misguided and bombastic\". The film grossed just $8.6 million, but the album was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries and selling 14 million copies. The lead single \"Desire\" became the band's first UK number-one song while reaching number three in the US. Facing creative stagnation and a critical backlash to Rattle and Hum, U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s through a new musical direction and public image.\n\n",

    "albumArtist": "Taylor Swift",
    "wikiDesc": "1989 is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 27, 2014, by Big Machine Records. Titled after Swift's birth year as a symbolic rebirth, the album recalibrated her artistic identity from country music to pop.\nSwift produced 1989 with Max Martin, Shellback, Jack Antonoff, Ryan Tedder, Nathan Chapman, and Imogen Heap. Its 1980s-inspired synth-pop production incorporates dense synthesizers, programmed drum machines, and processed electronic backing vocals, abandoning the acoustic arrangements that had characterized Swift's past albums. The songs chronicle the aftermath of a failed relationship with lyrics that expand on Swift's autobiographical details; they depict heartbreak, recovery, and self-discovery from lighthearted, wistful, and nostalgic perspectives.\n1989 was promoted with the 1989 World Tour, the highest-grossing concert tour of 2015. Seven singles supported the album, including the Billboard Hot 100 number-ones \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\", and the top-ten entries \"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\". In the United States, 1989 spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and was certified nine-times platinum. It is one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, having sold 14 million copies worldwide, and received platinum certifications in countries across Europe, the Americas, and Asia–Pacific. Swift and Big Machine withheld the album from free streaming services for nearly three years, which prompted an industry discourse on the impact of streaming on record sales.\nInitial reviews of 1989 were generally positive, praising its production as catchy and Swift's songwriting. However, some critics argued that the synth-pop production undermined Swift's singer-songwriter identity—a criticism that has been retrospectively regarded as rockist. 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards, and Rolling Stone listed it among their \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list. The album transformed Swift's status to a pop icon and promoted poptimism, and her heightened fame intensified media scrutiny on her public and private lives. Following a 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she released the re-recorded album 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023, and later acquired the original album's master recording in 2025.",

    "wikiDesc": "Kesha Rose Sebert (born March 1, 1987), formerly stylized as Ke$ha, is an American singer and songwriter. Her first major success came in 2009 when she was featured on rapper Flo Rida's number-one single, \"Right Round\".\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US Billboard 200 with Animal (2010) and Rainbow (2017), and the top-ten records Warrior (2012) and High Road (2020). She attained ten top-ten singles on the US Billboard Hot 100, including \"Tik Tok\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, \"My First Kiss\" with 3OH!3, \"Blah Blah Blah\", \"Your Love Is My Drug\", \"Take It Off\", \"We R Who We R\", \"Blow\", \"Die Young\", and \"Timber\" with Pitbull. Her 2009 single \"Tik Tok\" was the best-selling digital single in history, selling over 14 million units internationally, until surpassed in 2011. She fulfilled her five-album contract with Kemosabe Records by releasing the album Gag Order (2023), and released her first independent album, Period (2025), under her own label Kesha Records.\nKesha's career was halted between Warrior and Rainbow due to a legal dispute with her former producer Dr. Luke, which began in 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as Kesha v. Dr. Luke, were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claimed breach of contract and defamation. The case was settled out of court in June 2023.\nKesha is listed as the 26th top artist on Billboard's 2010s decade-end charts. She has received various awards and nominations, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act in 2010. Kesha has also co-written songs for other artists, including \"Till the World Ends\" (2011) for Britney Spears and songs for Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Miranda Cosgrove.\n\n",

    "albumArtist": "Panic! At The Disco",
    "wikiDesc": "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out is the debut studio album by American pop rock band Panic! at the Disco. Produced by Matt Squire, the album was released on September 27, 2005, through Decaydance and Fueled by Ramen. The group formed in Las Vegas in 2004 and began posting demos online, which caught the attention of Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz. Wentz signed the group to his own imprint label, Decaydance, without them having ever performed live. It is the only album released during original bassist Brent Wilson's time in the band, but the exact nature of his involvement in the writing and recording process became a source of contention upon his dismissal from the group in mid-2006.\nThe album was recorded on a small budget at SOMD! Studios in College Park, Maryland, over several weeks in June and July 2005. The group had only graduated from high school one month before. With lyrics written by lead guitarist and backing vocalist Ryan Ross, the album is divided into halves stylistically; the first half is primarily pop-punk with elements of electronic music, while the second half is more baroque pop-influenced, employing more traditional instrumentation. \nUpon its release, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out became a commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard 200. Its second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\",  peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, helping to bolster the album's sales to 1.8 million in the US by 2011, thus making it the group's best-selling release. Four other singles were released for the album: \"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\", which charted at number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100, \"But It's Better If You Do\", \"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\", and \"Build God, Then We'll Talk\".\nDespite its sales, the album polarized music critics, with many praising the album's catchiness and others criticizing its perceived lack of creativity. The band promoted the record with stints on the Nintendo Fusion Tour before its first headlining tour, the Nothing Rhymes with Circus Tour. In late 2015, it received a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 2 million US shipments. It then received a quadruple platinum certification in June 2023.\n\n",
